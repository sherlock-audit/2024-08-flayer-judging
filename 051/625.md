# Tax calculations on ```Listings::_resolveListingTax()``` will be wrong for all listings upon ```Locker::taxCalculator``` update.

### Summary

When the ```TaxCalculator``` update from the ```Locker::setTaxCalculator()```, all tax calculations on ```Listings::_resolveListingTax()```, since they assume that whatever tax is calculated with the new ```TaxCalculator``` is what was true for the whole duration of the listing.

### Root Cause

The main root cause of this vulnerability is that the ```Locker::setTaxCalculator()``` lacks the way to resolve all taxes for the listings before the change of the ```TaxCalculator```. In this way, every tax calculation after the change (resetting) of ```TaxCalculator``` assumes that this was the case from the start. Firstly, let's see the ```Locker::setTaxCalculator()``` :
```solidity
    function setTaxCalculator(address _taxCalculator) public onlyOwner {
        if (_taxCalculator == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
        taxCalculator = ITaxCalculator(_taxCalculator);
        emit TaxCalculatorContractUpdated(_taxCalculator);
    }
```

As you can see ```owner``` can change the ```Locker::TaxCalculator```, if he wants to change some configurations on the ```UTILIZATION_KINK```, the ```FLOOR_MULTIPLE_KINK``` and the other configurations like how the tax is calculated or from which utilization rate and after the interest starts to increase a lot etc.  However, this would cause serious problems on the tax calculations on ```Listings::_resolveListingTax()``` since it will use the new ```TaxCalculator``` as it was the initial one. Let's have a look :
```solidity
    function _resolveListingTax(Listing memory _listing, address _collection, bool _action) private returns (uint fees_, uint refund_) {
        // ...

        // Get the amount of tax in total that will have been paid for this listing
@>        uint taxPaid = getListingTaxRequired(_listing, _collection);
        if (taxPaid == 0) {
            return (fees_, refund_);
        }

       // ...
    }

      function getListingTaxRequired(Listing memory _listing, address _collection) public view returns (uint taxRequired_) {
        // Send our listing information to our {TaxCalculator} to calculate
@>        taxRequired_ = locker.taxCalculator().calculateTax(_collection, _listing.floorMultiple, _listing.duration);

        // Add our token denomination to support meme tokens
        taxRequired_ *= 10 ** locker.collectionToken(_collection).denomination();
    }
```

As we can see, the function will use the ```TaxCalculator``` to determine how much tax the user has already paid, but it will do it with the new formulas. Since the ```TaxCalculator``` has been changed (reset), this is not the actual case. Let's take for example the current ```TaxCalculator``` :
```solidity
    function calculateTax(address _collection, uint _floorMultiple, uint _duration) public pure returns (uint taxRequired_) {
        // If we have a high floor multiplier, then we want to soften the increase
        // after a set amount to promote grail listings.
        if (_floorMultiple > FLOOR_MULTIPLE_KINK) {
            _floorMultiple = FLOOR_MULTIPLE_KINK + ((_floorMultiple - FLOOR_MULTIPLE_KINK) / 2);
        }

        // Calculate the tax required per second
        taxRequired_ = (_floorMultiple ** 2 * 1e12 * _duration) / 7 days;
    }

    function calculateProtectedInterest(uint _utilizationRate) public pure returns (uint interestRate_) {
        // If we haven't reached our kink, then we can just return the base fee
        if (_utilizationRate <= UTILIZATION_KINK) {
            // Calculate percentage increase for input range 0 to 0.8 ether (2% to 8%)
            interestRate_ = 200 + (_utilizationRate * 600) / UTILIZATION_KINK;
        }
        // If we have passed our kink value, then we need to calculate our additional fee
        else {
            // Convert value in the range 0.8 to 1 to the respective percentage between 8% and
            // 100% and make it accurate to 2 decimal places.
            interestRate_ = (((_utilizationRate - UTILIZATION_KINK) * (100 - 8)) / (1 ether - UTILIZATION_KINK) + 8) * 100;
        }
    }
```

With the current formulas, a lister will pay X amount of tax when he lists his token for a ```Listing``` (the same with interest rates for ```ProtectedListings```), but when the ```TaxCalculator``` will be set again from ```Locker::setTaxCalculator()```, the ```Listings::_resolveListingTax()``` will assume that it paid the new calculation of tax.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> ```TaxCalculator``` **IS** expected to be changed in the future (at least there is open possibilities for this) since all similar (Collateralized Debt Position) protocols work this way but instead they take care of this by resolving any difference on tax/interest for their positions before the change. ```Utilization target rates``` and ```kink points``` are supposed to change for various reasons in these kind of protocols like marketing, low/high liquidity management and incentivise/disincentivise.


### Internal pre-conditions

1. Owner has set a ```TaxCalculator``` on ```Locker```.
2. Users have used ```Listings``` and ```PositionListings``` contracts.

### External pre-conditions

1. Owner needs to update the ```TaxCalculator```.

### Attack Path

1. Owner of ```Flayer``` sets a ```TaxCalculator``` on ```Locker```.
2. Users interact with ```Listings``` and ```PositionListings``` by depositing, borrowing etc.
3. Owner updates the ```TaxCalculator``` to disincentivize more liquidity to come to the protocol.
4. Now, calculations for the past like ```taxPaid``` are made as the new ```TaxCalculator``` was there from the start.

### Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is that the protocols accountings will be **totally** messed up, since it will assume that an X amount of tax was paid (```taxPaid```), while this is not the case and the user actually paid some another amount of tax when his started his listing. This will cause problems with the minting and burning of ```collectionTokens``` and the ```totalSupply``` of them will not reflect the reality (NTF <-> ```CollectionToken```).

### PoC

No PoC needed.

### Mitigation

Resolve any tax/interest difference for all positions before the tax calculator change from ```Locker::setTaxCalculator()```.
