# Potential Underflow in Listings Contract: Unchecked Decrement of listingCount

## Summary

A potential underflow vulnerability was detectedin the `Listings` contract at line 725. The unchecked decrement of the listingCount mapping could lead to an underflow if not properly managed.

## Vulnerability Detail

The code snippet in question decrements the listingCount for a given collection without any checks:

```solidity
unchecked { listingCount[_collection] -= 1; }

```
This operation is performed within an unchecked block, which means Solidity's built-in overflow/underflow protections are disabled. If `listingCount[_collection]` is already 0, this operation will cause an underflow, wrapping around to the maximum value of the uint256 type.

## Impact

If an underflow occurs, it could lead to severe inconsistencies in the contract's state. The listingCount for a collection could suddenly become extremely large, potentially disrupting other parts of the contract that rely on this count. This could lead to unexpected behavior, including potential DoS conditions or incorrect calculations based on the listing count.

**Code **Snippet**

```solidity
    function reserve(address _collection, uint _tokenId, uint _collateral) public nonReentrant lockerNotPaused {
        // Read the existing listing in a single read
        Listing memory oldListing = _listings[_collection][_tokenId];

        // Ensure the caller is not the owner of the listing
        if (oldListing.owner == msg.sender) revert CallerIsAlreadyOwner();

        // Ensure that the existing listing is available
        (bool isAvailable, uint listingPrice) = getListingPrice(_collection, _tokenId);
        if (!isAvailable) revert ListingNotAvailable();

        // Find the underlying {CollectionToken} attached to our collection
        ICollectionToken collectionToken = locker.collectionToken(_collection);

        // Check if the listing is a floor item and process additional logic if there
        // was an owner (meaning it was not floor, so liquid or dutch).
        if (oldListing.owner != address(0)) {
            // We can process a tax refund for the existing listing if it isn't a liquidation
            if (!_isLiquidation[_collection][_tokenId]) {
                (uint _fees,) = _resolveListingTax(oldListing, _collection, true);
                if (_fees != 0) {
                    emit ListingFeeCaptured(_collection, _tokenId, _fees);
                }
            }

            // If the floor multiple of the original listings is different, then this needs
            // to be paid to the original owner of the listing.
            uint listingFloorPrice = 1 ether * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination();
            if (listingPrice > listingFloorPrice) {
                unchecked {
                    collectionToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, oldListing.owner, listingPrice - listingFloorPrice);
                }
            }

            // Reduce the amount of listings
            unchecked { listingCount[_collection] -= 1; } //@audit this can underflow
        }

    //    Other parts of the code
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate this vulnerability, implement a check to ensure the listingCount is greater than zero before decrementing. Here's a suggested fix:

```solidity
    if (listingCount[_collection] > 0) {
    listingCount[_collection] -= 1;
}

```
