# Incorrect Validation Logic in collectionLiquidationComplete() Will Cause False Liquidation Status for Token Holders

### Summary

The incorrect validation logic in collectionLiquidationComplete() will cause false liquidation status for token holders as the function does not correctly check ownership of NFTs in the Sudoswap pool.

### Root Cause

In CollectionShutdown.sol:461, the function checks for NFT ownership by comparing the pool's address, but it assumes Sudoswap pools will always transfer ownership of NFTs.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The Sudoswap pool does not transfer ownership immediately.
2. Admin calls claim() or voteAndClaim() based on the liquidation status.

### External pre-conditions

1. Sudoswap uses delayed or partial liquidation.
2. Token holders rely on incorrect liquidation status to make claims.

### Attack Path

1. Admin calls execute() to create a Sudoswap pool.
2. Some NFTs remain unsold or in a delayed transfer state, but collectionLiquidationComplete() incorrectly returns true.
3. Token holders call claim() based on the incorrect liquidation status, causing premature ETH claims.

### Impact

The token holders suffer a false liquidation claim, receiving ETH before all NFTs are sold. The Sudoswap pool may still hold unsold NFTs, and further claims may fail.

### PoC

```solidity
for (uint i; i < sweeperPoolTokenIdsLength; ++i) {
    if (collection.ownerOf(params.sweeperPoolTokenIds[i]) == sweeperPool) {
        return false; // Check may fail if NFTs are pending sale
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

Implement a more accurate check for Sudoswap pool liquidation status by querying the Sudoswap pool contract directly for pending sales or transfers. This will ensure that claims are only allowed once all NFTs have been fully sold and ownership is transferred.
