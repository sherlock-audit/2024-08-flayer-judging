# Incorrect Fee Calculation Due to Wrong Divisor in ammFee Calculation

### Summary

The fee calculation in the UniswapImplementation contract uses an incorrect divisor when calculating the `ammFee`, potentially leading to fees that are 10 times higher than intended.

### Root Cause

In `UniswapImplementation.sol`, the `afterSwap` function calculates the `feeAmount` using a divisor of 100,000, while the `_ammFee.validate()` function uses a `MAX_LP_FEE` of 1,000,000. This mismatch leads to an incorrect fee calculation.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. UniswapImplementation contract is deployed with the incorrect fee calculation.
2. The `ammFee` is set to a non-zero value.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. **The `ammFee` is set to a value (e.g., 10,000, representing 1%)**
2. **A swap transaction is executed**
3. **The `afterSwap` function calculates the fee using the incorrect divisor**
4. **The user is charged a fee that is 10 times higher than intended**

### Impact

Users are overcharged for swap fees by a factor of 10. This leads to significant financial losses for users and unintended accumulation of fees in the protocol. It may also cause transactions to fail due to insufficient funds if the overcharged fee exceeds the user's balance.

### PoC

```solidity
function afterSwap(address sender, PoolKey calldata key, IPoolManager.SwapParams calldata params, BalanceDelta delta, bytes calldata hookData) public override onlyByPoolManager returns (bytes4 selector_, int128 hookDeltaSpecified_) {
    // ... (previous code)

    // Incorrect fee calculation
    uint feeAmount = uint128(swapAmount) * ammFee / 100_000;  // Should be 1_000_000

    // ... (remaining code)
}
```

### Mitigation

Update the fee calculation in the `afterSwap` function to use the correct divisor:

```solidity
function afterSwap(address sender, PoolKey calldata key, IPoolManager.SwapParams calldata params, BalanceDelta delta, bytes calldata hookData) public override onlyByPoolManager returns (bytes4 selector_, int128 hookDeltaSpecified_) {
    // ... (previous code)

    // Correct fee calculation
    uint feeAmount = uint128(swapAmount) * ammFee / 1_000_000;

    // ... (remaining code)
}
```
