# Previous `beneficiary` will not be able to claim `beneficiaryFees` if current beneficiary is a pool

## Summary
Previous `beneficiary` will not be able to claim `beneficiaryFees` if current beneficiary is a `pool`

## Vulnerability Detail
Beneficiary can claim their fees using `claim()`, which checks if the `beneficiaryIsPool` and if its true, it reverts
```solidity
function claim(address _beneficiary) public nonReentrant {
        // Ensure that the beneficiary has an amount available to claim. We don't revert
        // at this point as it could open an external protocol to DoS.
        uint amount = beneficiaryFees[_beneficiary];
        if (amount == 0) return;

        // We cannot make a direct claim if the beneficiary is a pool
@>      if (beneficiaryIsPool) revert BeneficiaryPoolCannotClaim();
...
    }
```
Above pointed check is a problem because it checks `beneficiaryIsPool` regardless of `_beneficiary` is current beneficiary or previous beneficiary. 

As result, if current beneficiary is a pool but previous beneficiary was not, then previous beneficiary will not be able to withdraw the fees as above check will revert because `beneficiaryIsPool` represents the status of current beneficiary.

//How this works
1. Suppose the current beneficiaryA is not a pool ie beneficiaryIsPool = false & receives a fees of 100e18
2. Owner changed the beneficiary using `setBeneficiary()` to beneficiaryB, which is a pool ie beneficiaryIsPool = true
3. Natspecs of the `setBeneficiary()` clearly says previous beneficiary should claim their fees, but they will not be able to claim because now beneficiaryIsPool = true, which will revert the transaction
```solidity
    /**
@>   * Allows our beneficiary address to be updated, changing the address that will
     * be allocated fees moving forward. The old beneficiary will still have access
     * to `claim` any fees that were generated whilst they were set.
     *
     * @param _beneficiary The new fee beneficiary
     * @param _isPool If the beneficiary is a Flayer pool
     */
    function setBeneficiary(address _beneficiary, bool _isPool) public onlyOwner {
        beneficiary = _beneficiary;
        beneficiaryIsPool = _isPool;

        // If we are setting the beneficiary to be a Flayer pool, then we want to
        // run some additional logic to confirm that this is a valid pool by checking
        // if we can match it to a corresponding {CollectionToken}.
        if (_isPool && address(locker.collectionToken(_beneficiary)) == address(0)) {
            revert BeneficiaryIsNotPool();
        }

        emit BeneficiaryUpdated(_beneficiary, _isPool);
    }
```

This issue is arising because beneficiaryIsPool is the status of the current beneficiary, but claim() can be used to claim fee by previous beneficiary also

## Impact
Previous beneficiary will not be able to claim their fees

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove the above check because if the beneficiary is a `pool` then their fees are store in a different mapping `_poolFee` not `beneficiaryFees`, which means any beneficiary which is a pool, will try to claim then it will revert as there `beneficiaryFee` will be 0(zero)
