# A malicious user can put any beneficiary address and claim fees from others

### Summary

In the function `claim` you can put a beneficiary as parameter and collect fees based on the beneficiary but there is no check that msg.sender = beneficiary, which allows theft of funds.

### Root Cause

```solidity
    function claim(address _beneficiary) public nonReentrant {
        // Ensure that the beneficiary has an amount available to claim. We don't revert
        // at this point as it could open an external protocol to DoS.
@>      uint amount = beneficiaryFees[_beneficiary];
        if (amount == 0) return;

        // We cannot make a direct claim if the beneficiary is a pool
        if (beneficiaryIsPool) revert BeneficiaryPoolCannotClaim();

        // Reduce the amount of fees allocated to the `beneficiary` for the token. This
        // helps to prevent reentrancy attacks.
        beneficiaryFees[_beneficiary] = 0;

        // Claim ETH equivalent available to the beneficiary
        IERC20(nativeToken).transfer(_beneficiary, amount);
        emit BeneficiaryFeesClaimed(_beneficiary, amount);
    }
```
As we can see this is a function that allows beneficiaries to collect fees thorugh this function, but a malicious actor can put any beneficiary that he wants as parameter and claim fees since there is no check to see if `_beneficiary` == `msg.sender`. An attacker can monitor the blockchain to see who has a lot of fees building up and claim any of them.
There is one instance of this [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/BaseImplementation.sol#L164C1-L180C6)

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. An attacker calls the function `claim` ,he uses a `beneficiary` address parameter that has a lot of fees
3. The function does not check for the sender to compare to the beneficiary and the attacker claims funds which are not his

### Impact

The attacker can theoretically claim all beneficiary fees.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider using a message sender comparison check e.g. 
```solidity
++ require(msg.sender == _beneficiary, "not beneficiary");
```
