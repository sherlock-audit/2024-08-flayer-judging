# `BaseImplementation:claim()` will be DoS for previous `beneficiary`

## Summary
`BaseImplementation:claim()` will be DoS for previous `beneficiary` due to a wrong check

## Vulnerability Detail
Previous beneficiary & current beneficiary can claim their fee using claim().
```solidity
 function claim(address _beneficiary) public nonReentrant {
        // Ensure that the beneficiary has an amount available to claim. We don't revert
        // at this point as it could open an external protocol to DoS.
        uint amount = beneficiaryFees[_beneficiary];
        if (amount == 0) return;

        // We cannot make a direct claim if the beneficiary is a pool
>       if (beneficiaryIsPool) revert BeneficiaryPoolCannotClaim();

        // Reduce the amount of fees allocated to the `beneficiary` for the token. This
        // helps to prevent reentrancy attacks.
        beneficiaryFees[_beneficiary] = 0;

        // Claim ETH equivalent available to the beneficiary
        IERC20(nativeToken).transfer(_beneficiary, amount);
        emit BeneficiaryFeesClaimed(_beneficiary, amount);
    }
```
Above pointed line checks if the beneficiary is pool or not. But the problem is `beneficiaryIsPool` represents the status of the current beneficiary not previous beneficiary. 

If the current beneficiary is a pool but previous beneficiary was not a pool then previous beneficiary will not be able to claim their fees due to above check.

Beneficiary can be changed using setBeneficiary(), which states that previous beneficiary should claim their fees.
```solidity
/**
     * Allows our beneficiary address to be updated, changing the address that will
     * be allocated fees moving forward. The old beneficiary will still have access
     * to `claim` any fees that were generated whilst they were set.
     *
     * @param _beneficiary The new fee beneficiary
     * @param _isPool If the beneficiary is a Flayer pool
     */
    function setBeneficiary(address _beneficiary, bool _isPool) public onlyOwner {
        beneficiary = _beneficiary;
        beneficiaryIsPool = _isPool;

        // If we are setting the beneficiary to be a Flayer pool, then we want to
        // run some additional logic to confirm that this is a valid pool by checking
        // if we can match it to a corresponding {CollectionToken}.
        if (_isPool && address(locker.collectionToken(_beneficiary)) == address(0)) {
            revert BeneficiaryIsNotPool();
        }

        emit BeneficiaryUpdated(_beneficiary, _isPool);
    }
```


## Impact
Claim() will DoS for the previous beneficiary, if current beneficiary is a pool
