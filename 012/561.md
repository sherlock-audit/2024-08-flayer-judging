# AMM beneficiary can not collect fees when beneficiary is a pool

### Summary

Any native tokens collected as AMM beneficiary fees are recorded in [`beneficiaryFees[ammBeneficiary]`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/UniswapImplementation.sol#L614). However, when the beneficiary is a Pool, those fees can not be [claimed](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/BaseImplementation.sol#L171).

Note that [`beneficiary`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/BaseImplementation.sol#L212) and [`AMM beneficiary`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/UniswapImplementation.sol#L819-L822) can be different.

### Root Cause

In [`BaseImplementation:171`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/BaseImplementation.sol#L171), claiming beneficiary fees will fail as long as the beneficiary is a pool. 

```solidity
function claim(address _beneficiary) public nonReentrant {
    // ... snip ...
    if (beneficiaryIsPool) revert BeneficiaryPoolCannotClaim();
}
```

This affects the AMM beneficiary too and prevents them from claiming their fees.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The admin has set a beneficiary as a [pool](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/BaseImplementation.sol#L213). 
2. An [AMM beneficiary](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/UniswapImplementation.sol#L819-L822) is set by admin. 

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Anyone swaps in one of Flayer's UniV4 Pools. This triggers the `afterSwap()` hook and [collects the AMM beneficiary fee](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/UniswapImplementation.sol#L596-L616). 
2. When the AMM beneficiary calls [`claim()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/BaseImplementation.sol#L164-L171), it reverts with a `BeneficiaryPoolCannotClaim()` error.
```solidity
    if (beneficiaryIsPool) revert BeneficiaryPoolCannotClaim();
```

### Impact

The AMM beneficiary will be [unable to claim](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/BaseImplementation.sol#L171) their fees. 

```solidity
function claim(address _beneficiary) public nonReentrant {
    uint amount = beneficiaryFees[_beneficiary];
    if (amount == 0) return;

    // We cannot make a direct claim if the beneficiary is a pool
    if (beneficiaryIsPool) revert BeneficiaryPoolCannotClaim();
    // ... snip ...
}
```

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider removing the `beneficiaryIsPool` check when claiming.

```diff
-    if (beneficiaryIsPool) revert BeneficiaryPoolCannotClaim();
```
