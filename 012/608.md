# Previous beneficiaries cannot claim tokens when `BaseImplementation::beneficiaryIsPool` is updated to true

## Summary
Previous beneficiaries cannot claim tokens when `BaseImplementation::beneficiaryIsPool` is updated to true.

## Vulnerability Detail
According to the documentation of the `BaseImplementation::setBeneficiary` function, the previous beneficiary should still be able to claim any fees generated while they were set as the beneficiary. However, the `BaseImplementation::claim` function will revert if `beneficiaryIsPool` is updated to true.

[BaseImplementation::setBeneficiary](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/BaseImplementation.sol#L211C5-L223) function:
```Solidity
/**
 * Allows our beneficiary address to be updated, changing the address that will
 * be allocated fees moving forward. The old beneficiary will still have access
 * to `claim` any fees that were generated whilst they were set.
 *
 * @param _beneficiary The new fee beneficiary
 * @param _isPool If the beneficiary is a Flayer pool 
 */
// @audit The old beneficiary can not claim when beneficiaryIsPool = true
function setBeneficiary(address _beneficiary, bool _isPool) public onlyOwner {
    ...
}
```

[BaseImplementation::claim](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/BaseImplementation.sol#L164-L180) function:
```Solidity
function claim(address _beneficiary) public nonReentrant {
    uint amount = beneficiaryFees[_beneficiary];
    if (amount == 0) return;

    // We cannot make a direct claim if the beneficiary is a pool
    if (beneficiaryIsPool) revert BeneficiaryPoolCannotClaim();
    ...
}
```

## Impact
Previous beneficiaries are unable to claim tokens.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a mapping between beneficiary addresses and a boolean to check if the beneficiary is a pool or not.
