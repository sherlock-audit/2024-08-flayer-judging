# Popular collections like `CryptoPunks/EtherRocks/Rare Pepes` will not be created due to strict `supportsInterface()` check

## Summary
Popular collections like `CryptoPunks/EtherRocks/Rare Pepes` will not be created due to strict `supportsInterface()` check

## Vulnerability Detail
Users can create collections using `Locker.createCollection()`, which takes the address of the collection & verifies that whether it supports `ERC721` interfaceId or not.
```solidity
function createCollection(address _collection, string calldata _name, string calldata _symbol, uint _denomination) public whenNotPaused returns (address) {
...
        // Validate if a contract does not appear to be a valid ERC721
@>      if (!IERC721(_collection).supportsInterface(0x80ac58cd)) revert InvalidERC721();
...
    }
```
The problem is, popular collections like CryptoPunks/ EtherRocks/ Rare Pepes are either `pre-ERC721` or build with `custom/hybrid` standards. 

As result, when they are used to create collections then it will `revert` because those collections will not return `0x80ac58cd` as interfaceId
 
## Impact
createCollection() will revert for popular collections like CryptoPunks/ EtherRocks/ Rare Pepes
