# Donation fees are sandwichable in one transaction

## Summary
Doesn't matters if MEV is openly possible in the chain, when eevr a user does actions like `liquidateProtectedListing`, `cancelListing`, `modifyListings`, `fillListings`, `Reserve` and `Relist`. They can sandwich the fees donation to make profit or recover the tax they paid. Or, the liquidaton is open access, so you can sandwich that in same tc itself.

Root casue : allowing more than max donation limit per transaction.

Even if you don't allow to donate more than max, the user will just loop the donation and still extract the $, so its better to have a max donation per block state that tracks this. So `donateThresholdMax` should be implemented in per block limit way.

## Vulnerability Detail

Uniswap openly advises to design the donation mechanism to not allow MEV extraction

https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-core/blob/18b223cab19dc778d9d287a82d29fee3e99162b0/src/interfaces/IPoolManager.sol#L167-L172

```SOLIDITY
 IPoolManager.sol
    /// @notice Donate the given currency amounts to the in-range liquidity providers of a pool
    /// @dev Calls to donate can be frontrun adding just-in-time liquidity, with the aim of receiving a portion donated funds.
    /// Donors should keep this in mind when designing donation mechanisms.
    /// @dev This function donates to in-range LPs at slot0.tick. In certain edge-cases of the swap algorithm, the `sqrtPrice` of
    /// a pool can be at the lower boundary of tick `n`, but the `slot0.tick` of the pool is already `n - 1`. In this case a call to
    /// `donate` would donate to tick `n - 1` (slot0.tick) not tick `n` (getTickAtSqrtPrice(slot0.sqrtPriceX96)).
```

Fees are donated to uniV4 pool in several listing actions
- `liquidateProtectedListing` : Amount worth `1 ether - listing.tokenTaken - KEEPER_REWARD` is donated. This amount will be huge in cases where, someone listed a protected listing and took 0.5 ether as token taken, but didnot unlock the listing. So since utilization rate became high, the listing heath gone negative and was put to liquidation during this time an amount f (1 ether - 0.5 ether taker - 0.05 ether keeper reward) = 0.40 ether is donated to pool. Thats a 1000$ direct donation
- Other 5 flows of Listings contract, such as `cancelListing`, `modifyListings`, `fillListings`, `Reserve` and `Relist` donate the tax fees to the pool. The likelihood is above medium to have huge amount when most users do multiple arrays of tokens of multiple collections done in one transaction.


Issue flow :
1. Figure out the tick where the donated fee will go in according to the @notice comment above on `IPoolManager.donate`.
2. And provide the in-range liquidity so heavy ( like 100x than available in the whole range of that pool).
3. Then do the `liquidateProtectedListing`, `cancelListing`, `modifyListings`, `fillListings`, `Reserve` and `Relist` actions that donate fees worth doing this sandwich
4. Then trigger a fee donation happening on `before swap` hook and then remove the provided liquidity in the first step.

You don't need to frontrun other user's actions, Just do this sandwiching whenever a liquidation of someone's listing happens. And you can also recover the paid tax/fees of your listings by this MEV. Or eevn better if chain allows to have public mempool, then every user's action is sandwichable.

## Impact
Loss of funds to the LPs. The fees they about to get due to LP, can be sandwiched and extracted. So high severity, and above medium likelihood even in the chans that doesn't have mempool. So, high severity.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Introduce a new way to track how much is donated on this block and limit it on evrery `_donate` call. example, allow only 0.1 ether per block
