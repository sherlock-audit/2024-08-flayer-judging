# Range of values for `duration` and `floorMultiple` will not work when creating listings

### Summary

The [valid range of values](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L275-L288) is 100 to 1000 for `floorMultiple` and 1 day to 180 days for `duration`. However, a range of valid values is impossible to use when creating a listing such as:
1. floor multiple of 1000 and duration of ~4 days or longer. The tax required with these parameters would be `1.12e18`.
2. max liquid duration (180 days) & 200 floor multiple. The tax required with these parameters would be `1.028e18`.

In both cases above, the [`taxRequired`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/TaxCalculator.sol#L35-L44) would be higher than the `tokensReceived` of 1 ether per tokenId and will [revert](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L146-L151). 

```solidity
// @audit the tokens received would be 1 ether for every token
tokensReceived = _mapListings(listing, tokensIdsLength) * 10 ** locker.collectionToken(listing.collection).denomination();

// Get the amount of tax required for the newly created listing
taxRequired = getListingTaxRequired(listing.listing, listing.collection) * tokensIdsLength;

if (taxRequired > tokensReceived) revert InsufficientTax(tokensReceived, taxRequired);
unchecked { tokensReceived -= taxRequired; }
```

### Root Cause

The choice to [revert](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L150) when the `taxRequired > tokensReceived` is a mistake as it will cause many valid listings to not be created. 

```solidity
if (taxRequired > tokensReceived) revert InsufficientTax(tokensReceived, taxRequired);
```

Either that or adjust the tax calculation so that it is possible to create listings for longer durations at higher floor multiples.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Anyone calls `Listings::createListings()` with duration of 14 days and floor multiple of 1000. They want to price their NFT at 10x floor price and a liquid listing since they do not want their listing to immediately go on Dutch auction.

### Impact

Users can not create a liquid listing to sell their rare NFTs at 10x floor price. Note that rares in some collections can have prices of 10-30x of floor items. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider adjusting the [tax calculation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/TaxCalculator.sol#L35-L44) to allow for listings at higher floor multiples and longer durations. Also, consider allowing users to pay for the `taxRequired` in excess of the `tokensReceived`.
