# The `Listings.sol#createListings()` function fails to create some Listings.

### Summary

Some Listings that follow the protocol cannot be created due to the implementation of constraints in the `Listings.sol#createListings()` function.


### Root Cause

In the `Listings.sol#createListings()` function, `taxRequired` is set to 1 ether.


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

In the 'Listings.sol#Createlistings ()' function, 'taxrequed' is limited to less than 1 Ether, and some Listing cannot be created.


### Impact

Mismatch with the implementation of the protocol

### PoC

In Protocol, 'duration' and 'floorMultiple' were defined as follows.
```solidity
    /// Define our minimum floor multiple
    uint internal constant MIN_FLOOR_MULTIPLE = 100;

    uint16 public constant MAX_FLOOR_MULTIPLE = 10_00;

    /// Minimum and maximum liquid listing durations
    uint32 public constant MIN_LIQUID_DURATION = 7 days;
    uint32 public constant MAX_LIQUID_DURATION = 180 days;

    /// Minimum and maximum dutch listing durations
    uint32 public constant MIN_DUTCH_DURATION = 1 days;
    uint32 public constant MAX_DUTCH_DURATION = 7 days - 1;

    /// The dutch duration for an expired liquid listing
    uint32 public constant LIQUID_DUTCH_DURATION = 4 days;
```

As you can see, the range of 'duration' is '100 ~ 1000' and 'floorMultiple' is '1 days ~ 180 days'.

However, in the ['Listings.sol#createListings()'](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L149-L150) function, Listing is limited only if 'taxRequed' is 1 ether.

`taxRequed` is calculated as follows:
```solidity
    function getListingTaxRequired(Listing memory _listing, address _collection) public view returns (uint taxRequired_) {
        // Send our listing information to our {TaxCalculator} to calculate
        taxRequired_ = locker.taxCalculator().calculateTax(_collection, _listing.floorMultiple, _listing.duration);

        // Add our token denomination to support meme tokens
        taxRequired_ *= 10 ** locker.collectionToken(_collection).denomination();
    }
```

```solidity
    function calculateTax(address _collection, uint _floorMultiple, uint _duration) public pure returns (uint taxRequired_) {
        // If we have a high floor multiplier, then we want to soften the increase
        // after a set amount to promote grail listings.
        if (_floorMultiple > FLOOR_MULTIPLE_KINK) {
            _floorMultiple = FLOOR_MULTIPLE_KINK + ((_floorMultiple - FLOOR_MULTIPLE_KINK) / 2);
        }

        // Calculate the tax required per second
        taxRequired_ = (_floorMultiple ** 2 * 1e12 * _duration) / 7 days;
    }
```

According to the Code provided in the right, 'Taxrequed' can exceed 1 Ether.

As a result, this is violating the specification of the protocol.


### Mitigation

Consider allowing all listing to be created.
