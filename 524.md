# malicious user can brick claiming funds for a collection

### Summary

The `CollectionShutdown::claim(...)` can be bricked by a user preventing users from claiming their funds.

This attack is cheaper for NFTs that have low floor prices. And it could as well be performed by a well funded user

### Root Cause

When a user calls [`claim(...)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L285-L295), a call is made to the [`collectionLiquidationComplete(...)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L459-L464) function to check if the sweeper pool still owns any of its pool tokens. If it does, then the `claim function revert


```solidity
File: CollectionShutdown.sol
285:     function claim(address _collection, address payable _claimant) public nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
SNIP.   ..........
293: 
294:         // Ensure that all NFTs have sold from our Sudoswap pool
295:   @>    if (!collectionLiquidationComplete(_collection)) revert NotAllTokensSold();
............


445:     function collectionLiquidationComplete(address _collection) public view returns (bool) {
SNIP       .............
459:         for (uint i; i < sweeperPoolTokenIdsLength; ++i) {
460:             // If the pool still owns the NFT, then we have to revert as not all tokens have been sold
461:    @>       if (collection.ownerOf(params.sweeperPoolTokenIds[i]) == sweeperPool) {
462:       @>        return false;
463:             }
464:         }
465: 
466:         return true;
467:     }

```

The problem is that a user who purchased  on or more of the `sweeperPoolTokenIds` can send the token back to the `sweeperPool` so that the claim function reverts when `collectionLiquidationComplete(...)` is called, thus causing funds to be stuck in the contract.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- Alice purchased a `sweeperPoolTokenId`
- All other NFTs have been sold from the pool
- Alice sends her purchased token back to the pool
- user calls `claim(...)` but the function reverts

### Impact

Users are unable to claim their funds and as such the funds are stuck in the `CollectionShutdown` contract without a way to withdraw, leading to a loss of funds

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider implementing a mechanism to rescue tokens directly from the `pairFactory`
