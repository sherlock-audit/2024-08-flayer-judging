# Listing owner may suffer bad a trade during the period when Locker is paused

## Summary
Listing owner may suffer bad a trade during the period when Locker is paused.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a listing is created, the listing owner is able to modify(adjust), cancel(unlock) the listing at any time they see fit to reduce fee/interst costs, and other users can also fill the listing when the price is good to them.

However, all those are not possible when the Locker contract is paused, as the functions are guarded by `lockerNotPaused` modifier.

[Listings.sol#L303](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L303):
```solidity
    function modifyListings(address _collection, ModifyListing[] calldata _modifyListings, bool _payTaxWithEscrow) public nonReentrant lockerNotPaused returns (uint taxRequired_, uint refund_) {
``` 

[Listings.sol#L414](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L414):
```solidity
    function cancelListings(address _collection, uint[] memory _tokenIds, bool _payTaxWithEscrow) public lockerNotPaused {
```

[Listings.sol#L528](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L528):
```solidity
    function fillListings(FillListingsParams calldata params) public nonReentrant lockerNotPaused {
```

[ProtectedListings.sol#L287](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L287):
```solidity
    function unlockProtectedListing(address _collection, uint _tokenId, bool _withdraw) public lockerNotPaused {
```

[ProtectedListings.sol#L366](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L366):
```solidity
    function adjustPosition(address _collection, uint _tokenId, int _amount) public lockerNotPaused {
```

The problem is that when calculates fees/interests, the paused period is not took into consideration, and this has impacts to different types of listing:

> LIQUID Listing

When Locker contract is paused, user won't be able to modify or cancel a listing, they have to suffer the fees accrued during the period, and it may eventually change to a DUTCH listing, results in the listing cannot be cancelled and is filled with at floor price when Locker contract is unpaused.
 
> DUTCH Listing

The listing cannot be filled during paused period even if users want to, and it will be filled at floor price when Locker contract is unpaused.

> Protected Listing

User won't be able to unlock a protected listing or adjust the position in time, it will be liquidated eventually after Locker contract's paused period.

## Impact

Manual Review

## Recommendation

During paused period, fees and Interests should not be accrued, nor should the DUTCH price drop.
