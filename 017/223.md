# The AirdropRecipient contract is missing a payable fallback() or receive() function, which prevents it from receiving native token airdrops.


## Summary
The AirdropRecipient contract is missing a payable fallback() or receive() function, which prevents it from receiving native token airdrops.
## Vulnerability Detail
The AirdropRecipient contract is missing a payable fallback() or receive() function. The Locker contract inherits from the AirdropRecipient contract, but Locker also lacks a fallback() or receive() function. Since Locker holds all the locked NFTs, it is responsible for claiming airdrops from third-party contracts and then distributing them to the listing users. The AirdropRecipient::requestAirdrop() function further supports this point.
```javascript
function requestAirdrop(address _contract, bytes calldata _payload) public payable onlyOwner nonReentrant returns (bool success_, bytes memory data_) {
        if (msg.value > 0) {
            (success_, data_) = _contract.call{value: msg.value}(_payload);
        } else {
            (success_, data_) = _contract.call(_payload);
        }

        if (!success_) revert ExternalCallFailed();
    }
```
However, since the AirdropRecipient contract is missing a payable fallback() or receive() function, it is impossible to receive native token airdrops from third-party contracts.
## Impact
The inability to receive native token airdrops results in financial loss.
