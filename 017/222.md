# The AirdropRecipient contract is missing onERC721Received() function, which prevents it from receiving ERC721 token airdrops.


## Summary
The AirdropRecipient contract is missing onERC721Received() function, which prevents it from receiving ERC721 token airdrops.
## Vulnerability Detail
The AirdropRecipient contract is missing the onERC721Received() function. The Locker contract inherits from the AirdropRecipient contract, but Locker also lacks the onERC721Received() function. Since Locker holds all the lock-up NFTs, it is responsible for claiming airdrops from third-party contracts and then distributing them to the listing users. The AirdropRecipient::requestAirdrop() function further supports this point.
```javascript
function requestAirdrop(address _contract, bytes calldata _payload) public payable onlyOwner nonReentrant returns (bool success_, bytes memory data_) {
        if (msg.value > 0) {
            (success_, data_) = _contract.call{value: msg.value}(_payload);
        } else {
            (success_, data_) = _contract.call(_payload);
        }

        if (!success_) revert ExternalCallFailed();
    }
```
However, since the AirdropRecipient contract is missing the onERC721Received() function, it is impossible to receive ERC721 token airdrops from third-party contracts. This is because when a third-party contract transfers an ERC721 token to the Locker contract, it will almost always call the onERC721Received() function of Locker.
## Impact
The inability to receive ERC721 token airdrops results in financial loss.
