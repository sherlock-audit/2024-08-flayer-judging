# Native claimType airdrops aren't possible due to missing receive() function

## Summary
Neither AirdropRecipient.sol nor Locker.sol has a payable receive() function.

## Vulnerability Detail
NATIVE claim type would be ETH, BUT AirdropRecipient.sol x Locker.sol doesn't have a receive() function to receive the ETH for claimants to claim.

so native claim type airdrops aren't currently possible.

```solidity
 } else if (_claimType == Enums.ClaimType.NATIVE) {
            (bool sent,) = payable(_node.recipient).call{value: _node.amount}('');
            if (!sent) revert TransferFailed();
        }
```


## Impact
Native claimType airdrops aren't possible
