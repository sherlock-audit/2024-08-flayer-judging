# Wrong assumption when getting ERC721 and ERC1155 royalties

## Summary
When getting the ERC1155 royalties all ids are assumed to have the same royalty.
## Vulnerability Detail
When a package is made in the `crossTheThreshold721` the royaltyBps is taken only from the first id and is applied to every other id of the same collection:

 This will create opportunities for extracting more or less royalty.
The ERC2981 standard has the following function for getting the royalty:

As we can see every token has its own royalty:
```solidity
 function royaltyInfo(uint256 tokenId, uint256 salePrice) public view virtual returns (address, uint256) {
        RoyaltyInfo storage _royaltyInfo = _tokenRoyaltyInfo[tokenId];
        address royaltyReceiver = _royaltyInfo.receiver;
        uint96 royaltyFraction = _royaltyInfo.royaltyFraction;
```
The same is applicable for the `crossTheThreshold1155` function as well.
## Impact
High users will be able to manipulate the royalty and choose the most profitable one.

## Recommendation
Rewrite the code so that each id has its own royalty.
