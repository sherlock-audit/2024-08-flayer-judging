# Native ETH Sending Not Protected in Functions

## Summary
Two functions, `claim` and `voteAndClaim`, in the `CollectionShutdown.sol` contract lack proper checks when handling native ETH transfers. There are no checks to ensure `msg.sender` is properly validated in these cases.

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract sends native ETH without fully ensuring `msg.sender` is valid, which could allow unintended parties to receive funds. This vulnerability occurs in the `claim` function and the `voteAndClaim` function.

## Impact
An attacker or unauthorized user could exploit this lack of validation to claim ETH improperly, leading to unauthorized fund transfers and financial loss. This issue affects functions that interact with ETH transfers in liquidation or claiming mechanisms.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Introduce sender validation checks before initiating ETH transfers to ensure the correct and authorized user receives the funds. For instance, verify that `msg.sender` is the rightful owner of the claim or that it matches the intended recipient of the transaction.
