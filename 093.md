# There is no minimum limit for the amount of collateral for placing orders, resulting in a loophole of insufficient liquidation incentives

## Summary
There is no minimum limit for the tokenTaken in the protected order book, allowing users to submit extremely low collateral amounts. This leads to insufficient liquidation incentives, and the Keeper may lack sufficient economic motivation to perform liquidation operations.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the protected order mechanism, users can pledge a certain amount of tokens to ensure the security of their orders. However, the contract only sets a maximum pledge limit (MAX_PROTECTED_TOKEN_AMOUNT) and no minimum limit (MIN_PROTECTED_TOKEN_AMOUNT). Therefore, users can submit very small pledge amounts, such as 0.01 ether, while the Keeper's liquidation reward is 0.05 ether. Since the liquidation cost is higher than the reward, the Keeper will not have enough motivation to trigger the liquidation operation, resulting in the order not being liquidated in time, affecting the normal operation of the system.



## Impact
• User A created many orders, each with a collateral of 0.01 ether
• When each order is liquidated, the guardian can only get 0.05 ether, but because the collateral amount of these orders is very low, the cost of clearing them (transaction fees, etc.) far exceeds the guardian's expected return, resulting in the inability to effectively carry out the liquidation operation.
• The number of orders in the system continues to accumulate, the system performance declines, and the market is difficult to operate normally.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
        // Validate the amount of token the user wants to take
        if (listing.tokenTaken == 0) revert TokenAmountIsZero();
        if (listing.tokenTaken > MAX_PROTECTED_TOKEN_AMOUNT) revert TokenAmountExceedsMax();
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Introduce the MIN_PROTECTED_TOKEN_AMOUNT constant in the contract to set a reasonable minimum collateral limit. This ensures that the collateral amount of the order is high enough to maintain liquidation incentives and prevent system abuse. For example, 0.1 ether can be set as the minimum collateral limit:
```solidity
uint public constant MIN_PROTECTED_TOKEN_AMOUNT = 0.1 ether;



        // Validate the amount of token the user wants to take
        if (listing.tokenTaken == 0) revert TokenAmountIsZero();
        if (listing.tokenTaken > MAX_PROTECTED_TOKEN_AMOUNT) revert TokenAmountExceedsMax();
        if (listing.tokenTaken < MIN_PROTECTED_TOKEN_AMOUNT) revert TokenAmountBelowMin();
```
