# Incorrect Handling of Token Denominations

## Summary

The contract frequently multiplies token amounts by both 1 ether and 10 ** locker.collectionToken(...).denomination(). This double scaling can lead to exceedingly large values, especially if the token’s denomination is already set to 18 (a common standard for ERC20 tokens).

## Vulnerability Detail

In createListings()

`tokensReceived = _mapListings(listing, tokensIdsLength) * 10 ** locker.collectionToken(listing.collection).denomination(); `

Here, _mapListings returns tokensReceived_ = _tokenIds * 1 ether, which is already 1 * 10^18. Multiplying this by 10 ** 18 (if denomination is 18) results in tokensReceived = _tokenIds * 10^36, which is incorrect.

In cancelListings()
`uint requiredAmount = ((1 ether * _tokenIds.length) * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination()) - refund; `
Similar to the above, if _tokenIds.length = 1 and denomination = 18, requiredAmount becomes 10^36 - refund, which is not a valid ERC20 token amount.

## Impact

Users might receive or be required to pay amounts that are astronomically high, effectively rendering the contract unusable for practical purposes.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove one layer of scaling. Typically, ERC20 tokens already account for their denomination, so using 1 ether (which is 10^18 wei) alongside 10 ** denomination is redundant. Instead, standardize the scaling based on the token’s denomination.
