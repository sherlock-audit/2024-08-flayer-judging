# Non-Compliant ERC-1271 Signature Validation in AirdropRecipient Contract

### Summary


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/AirdropRecipient.sol#L58

The `isValidSignature` function in `AirdropRecipient.sol` incorrectly returns `bytes4(0xffffffff)` for invalid signatures instead of reverting, violating the ERC-1271 standard. This erroneous behavior can be triggered whenever an external protocol or application interacts with the contract, attempting to verify a signature using this function.

### 3. Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Flow:

1. **External Protocol Interaction:** An external protocol, intending to verify a signature, interacts with the `isValidSignature` function, passing an invalid signature and its corresponding hash.
2. **Incorrect Signature Validation:** The `isValidSignature` function, using `SignatureCheckerLib.isValidSignatureNow`, determines that the signature is invalid.
3. **Erroneous Return Value:** Instead of reverting, as dictated by the ERC-1271 standard, the function returns `bytes4(0xffffffff)`.
4. **False Positive:** The external protocol, unaware of this deviation from the standard, interprets `bytes4(0xffffffff)` as an indication of a valid signature.

### 4. Impact:

This bug can have severe consequences, particularly for the security and reliability of the `AirdropRecipient` contract:

* **False Positive Signature Verification:** This can lead to the acceptance of forged approvals or execution of unauthorized actions by malicious actors. Imagine a scenario where airdrop claims are authenticated using signatures. A malicious actor could craft an invalid signature and use this bug to claim airdrops that they are not entitled to, depleting funds intended for legitimate recipients. 
* **Bypassing Security Measures:** External protocols, especially those responsible for critical operations like asset transfers or fund management, rely on the `isValidSignature` function for security. This bug essentially allows these security measures to be bypassed with an invalid signature.

**Recommendation:**

The code should be immediately rectified to strictly comply with the ERC-1271 standard. The `isValidSignature` function must revert for invalid signatures, ensuring robust security and preventing the possibility of exploitation.
