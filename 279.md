# Attacker can prevent shutdown execution by withdrawing locked tokens

### Summary

The admin passes a list of tokenIds to pull from the locker when a shutdown is executed. By frontrunning the tx and removing one of those tokens from the locker the attacker can cause the tx to revert.

### Root Cause

In [CollectionShutdown.sol:256](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L256) it will loop over the passed tokenIds and remove them from the locker. If the locker does not own one of those tokens, the tx will revert.

Any user who owns enough collection tokens can withdraw **any** token of that collection from the locker. So whichever tokens the admin passes to `execute()` the attacker can frontrun their tx. And, the admin **must** provide tokenIds.
