# Incorrect use of `1000` for converting basis points to decimals in `compoundedFactor_` calculation

## Summary

The calculation of the compounded factor in the [`TaxCalculator::calculateCompoundedFactor()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/TaxCalculator.sol#L80-L91) incorrectly uses `1000` as the divisor to convert basis points to decimals. Basis points represent two decimal places (e.g., 200 -> 2% -> 0.02) but should use `10000` as the divisor to convert them to decimals (10000 -> 100% -> 1). This mistake causes incorrect interest calculations.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the [`TaxCalculator::calculateCompoundedFactor()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/TaxCalculator.sol#L80-L91), the `interestRate` is in basis points with 1e2 precision, and is correctly expanded with 1e18 to match precision for further calculations. 

However, when converting the per-second rate to decimals for compounded factor calculation, the divisor used is `1000`. This is incorrect, as basis points require division by `10000` to represent percentages accurately in decimal format.

The use of 1000 instead of 10000 leads to incorrect calculations for the compounded interest factor, affecting any logic dependent on the compounded interest.

## Impact


Overestimation of the compounded interest rate by a factor of 10,000/1,000 = 10x. As a result, users are charged incorrect interest rates. 

The impact of this error grows linearly for utilization rates below the kink (2% -> 8%) and increases rapidly after passing the kink threshold (8% -> 100%).
