# Incorrect Order of Division and Multiplication

## Summary
Precision loss in calculation 

## Vulnerability Detail
Division operations followed directly by multiplication operations can lead to precision loss due to the way integer arithmetic is handled in Solidity.

## Impact
precision loss 

## Code Snippet
- Found in src/contracts/TaxCalculator.sol [Line: 90](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/TaxCalculator.sol#L90)

```solidity
        compoundedFactor_ = _previousCompoundedFactor * (1e18 + (perSecondRate / 1000 * _timePeriod)) / 1e18;
```
## Tool used
