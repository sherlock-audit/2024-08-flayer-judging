# Compounded Factor Miscalculated Due to Improper Interest Rate Scaling

### Summary

In the TaxCalculator contract, [calculateCompoundedFactor](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/TaxCalculator.sol#L80-L91) calculations are incorrect due to improper scaling. The interest rate, returned with two decimal precision, is mistakenly divided by 1,000 instead of 10,000, leading to an inflated interest rate.


### Root Cause

In TaxCalculator contract, when computing the compounded factor, [TaxCalculator::calculateProtectedInterest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/TaxCalculator.sol#L59-L71) is queried to return the current interest rate based on the utilization rate. The returned interest rate here is scaled by 2 decimal precision. i.e. A 2% interest rate is represented as 200.
But when converting this rate to percentage, the code currently divides by 1,000:
```solidity
        compoundedFactor_ =
            (_previousCompoundedFactor *
                (1e18 + ((perSecondRate / 1000) * _timePeriod))) /
            1e18;
```
When 200/1000 => 0.2, which is 20%.


### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

The incorrect calculation results in inflated interest rates, which otherwise results in an inflated `compoundedFactor`

### Mitigation


Should divide by 10_000 to get the actual percentage value
i.e.:
```solidity
(perSecondRate / 10000 * _timePeriod)

```
