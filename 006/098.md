# Wrong divisor in `TaxCalculator.sol::calculateCompoundedFactor` leads to 10x interest rates

### Summary

The divisor in [TaxCalculator.sol::calculateCompoundedFactor](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/TaxCalculator.sol#L90) should be `10_000`. but it's `1000`. As a result, the users of `ProtectedListings` will pay 10x interest rates wrt. what they expect.

### Root Cause

In [TaxCalculator.sol::calculateCompoundedFactor](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/TaxCalculator.sol#L90) the divisor is set to `1000`:

```solidity
compoundedFactor_ = _previousCompoundedFactor * (1e18 + (perSecondRate / 1000 * _timePeriod)) / 1e18;
```

As `perSecondRate` is in percents with two digits precision (i.e. 2% becomes 200); to normalize this, the divisor `10_000` should be used.


### Internal pre-conditions

none

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

none

### Impact

Definite loss of funds: The users of `ProtectedListings` will pay 10x interest rate wrt. what they expect. This means that the loss of funds wrt. the expected interest rate amount is 900%.

### PoC

This is already demonstrated by the existing tests, e.g. in [TaxCalculator.t.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/test/TaxCalculator.t.sol#L83) we have:

```solidity
        _assertCompound(4.9863023 ether, 100_00, YEAR);
```

In the above, the `principle` used is `0.5 ether`, and the compounded interest over 1 year with `100%` annual rate is ~`5 ether`, while it should be ~`0.5 ether`.
