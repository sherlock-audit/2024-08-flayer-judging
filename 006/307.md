# Incorrect order of division and multiplication leading to precision loss in tax calculations

## Summary
The contract `TaxCalculator` performs division in the function `calculateCompoundedFactor` before multiplication in a tax calculation, leading to potential precision loss due to Solidity's integer arithmetic. Specifically, the expression performs division followed by multiplication, which can lead to truncation of values, impacting the accuracy of tax computations.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the following line of code from `TaxCalculator::calculateCompoundedFactor`:

```solidity
 compoundedFactor_ = _previousCompoundedFactor * (1e18 + (perSecondRate / 1000 * _timePeriod)) / 1e18;
```

The division `perSecondRate / 1000` is performed before multiplying by `_timePeriod`, leading to potential precision loss due to truncation during integer division.

In Solidity, when two integers are divided, any fractional component is discarded, resulting in a loss of precision. By dividing first, important decimal data could be lost before performing the subsequent multiplication, reducing the accuracy of the compounded tax calculation.

## Impact
**Financial discrepancies:** Taxes collected might be lower or higher than intended, causing incorrect amounts to be charged.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To avoid precision loss, rearrange the operations to ensure multiplication is performed before division:

```solidity
compoundedFactor_ = _previousCompoundedFactor * (1e18 + (perSecondRate * _timePeriod / 1000)) / 1e18;
```
