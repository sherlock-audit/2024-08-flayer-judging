# Loss of Precision in `Taxcalculator::calculateProtectedInterest()` due to division before multiplication.

## Summary
There's a possible loss of precision due to division before multiplication in `Taxcalculator::calculateProtectedInterest()` which can lead to miscalculation of the `_interestRate()`


## Vulnerability Detail
There's a possible loss of precision due to division before multiplication in `Taxcalculator::calculateProtectedInterest()` which can lead to miscalculation of the `_interestRate()`
## Vulnerability Detail
The function [calculateProtectedInterest()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/TaxCalculator.sol#L59-L71) is used to calculate the interest rate for the protected listings. But the issue here is that the method of calculating the `interestRate` when the `KINK` value has been exceeded is susceptible to precision loss due to division before multiplication which can generate wrong values for the `CompoundedFactor`.

Here is an illustration with simplified values to further express the point
The present code for the derivation of `interestRate_` when the `KINK` has been exceeded.
```solidity
interestRate_ = (((_utilizationRate - UTILIZATION_KINK) * (100 - 8)) / (1 ether - UTILIZATION_KINK) + 8) * 100;
```

lets take for example that our _utlizatiomRate = 0.8 and UTILIZATION_INK = 0.5
```solidity
interestRate_ = (((0.8 ether - 0.5 ether) * (100 - 8)) / (1 ether - 0.5 ether) + 8) * 100;
             = ((0.3 ether * 92) / 0.5 ether + 8) * 100;
             = (27.6 ether / 0.5 ether + 8) * 100; //here 27.6 / 0.5 will give 55.2 but solidity truncates this value to 55.
             = (55 + 8) * 100;
             = 6300.
```
But when properly corrected it can be seen to give a value with better precision.

```solidity
interestRate_ = (((0.8 ether - 0.5 ether) * (100 - 8) * 100) / (1 ether - 0.5 ether) + 8) * 100;
             = ((0.3 ether * 92 * 100) / 0.5 ether) + 800;
             = (2760 ether / 0.5 ether) + 800;
             = 5520 + 800; //here the precision is preserved.
             = 6320.
```


## Impact
This will lead to part of the interest which should have accrued on the `protectedListings` of users being lost, leading to loss of funds for the protocol as users pay less when unlocking their protected listing.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
 function calculateProtectedInterest(uint _utilizationRate) public pure returns (uint interestRate_) {
        // If we haven't reached our kink, then we can just return the base fee
        if (_utilizationRate <= UTILIZATION_KINK) {
            // Calculate percentage increase for input range 0 to 0.8 ether (2% to 8%)
            interestRate_ = 200 + (_utilizationRate * 600) / UTILIZATION_KINK;
        }
        // If we have passed our kink value, then we need to calculate our additional fee
        else {
            // Convert value in the range 0.8 to 1 to the respective percentage between 8% and
            // 100% and make it accurate to 2 decimal places.
   @>       interestRate_ = (((_utilizationRate - UTILIZATION_KINK) * (100 - 8)) / (1 ether - UTILIZATION_KINK) + 8) * 100;
```


## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Rearrange the code by multiplying by 100 before performing the division, which scales up the numerator and preserves more precision during the division operation.

```diff
 function calculateProtectedInterest(uint _utilizationRate) public pure returns (uint interestRate_) {
        // If we haven't reached our kink, then we can just return the base fee
        if (_utilizationRate <= UTILIZATION_KINK) {
            // Calculate percentage increase for input range 0 to 0.8 ether (2% to 8%)
            interestRate_ = 200 + (_utilizationRate * 600) / UTILIZATION_KINK;
        }
        // If we have passed our kink value, then we need to calculate our additional fee
        else {
            // Convert value in the range 0.8 to 1 to the respective percentage between 8% and
            // 100% and make it accurate to 2 decimal places.
--          interestRate_ = (((_utilizationRate - UTILIZATION_KINK) * (100 - 8)) / (1 ether - UTILIZATION_KINK) + 8) * 100;
++          interestRate_ = (((_utilizationRate - UTILIZATION_KINK) * (100 - 8) * 100) / (1 ether - UTILIZATION_KINK) + 8) * 100;
            
        }
    }
```
Here the precision is more preserved than in the initial method.
