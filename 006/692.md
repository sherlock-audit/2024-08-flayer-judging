# LOSS OF PRECISION WHEN CALCULATING INTEREST RATE

## Summary
The ``TaxCalculator::calculateProtectedInterest``  function is responsible for determining the interest rate based on the ``utilization rate`` of a protocol; which can range from 0(nothing being used) to 1e18(all items are protected listings). However, it suffers from precision loss due to improper handling of fixed-point arithmetic, which can cause inaccuracies, especially when dealing with values close to the kink ``(utilization threshold)``. The precision loss occurs when the calculations involving Ether precision (1e18) are mixed with fixed-point arithmetic (interest rates in percentage or basis points).
## Vulnerability Detail
The main issue arises from the calculation of the interest rate when the utilization rate exceeds the kink ``(UTILIZATION_KINK)``. The second block of the function performs arithmetic using integers, which leads to rounding errors when values are multiplied or divided without accounting for Ether-level precision.

When operating on values above of 0.8 ether (80% utilization), this arithmetic involves both percentage points and Ether values, which need proper scaling to maintain precision. Failing to do this results in inaccurate interest rates, especially when utilization is high.
## Impact
 Incorrectly calculating interest rates affects the protocol’s capital efficiency.

```solidity
 function calculateProtectedInterest(
        uint _utilizationRate
    ) public pure returns (uint interestRate_) {
        // If we haven't reached our kink, then we can just return the base fee
        if (_utilizationRate <= UTILIZATION_KINK) {
            // Calculate percentage increase for input range 0 to 0.8 ether (2% to 8%)
            interestRate_ = 200 + (_utilizationRate * 600) / UTILIZATION_KINK;
        }
        // If we have passed our kink value, then we need to calculate our additional fee
        else {
            // Convert value in the range 0.8 to 1 to the respective percentage between 8% and
            // 100% and make it accurate to 2 decimal places.
          @>  interestRate_ =
                (((_utilizationRate - UTILIZATION_KINK) * (100 - 8)) /
                    (1 ether - UTILIZATION_KINK) +
                    8) *
                100;
        }
    }
```

They are other values of utilzationRate where this Precision Loss is also encountered
 Mitigation:
  - Precision with large constants:
   - Use higher precision scaling (e.g., multiplying by 1e18 before dividing) to maintain precision.
