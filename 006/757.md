# Precison loss is tax calculation

## Summary
There is a precison loss in the calculation of tax due to an incorrect order of handling calculation
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `TaxCalculator::calculateProtectedInterest`, the instrad rate is calculated such that there is a division before multiplication, which usually an issue in solidity, as solidity does not support decimal. To avoid rounding errors to the bearest minimum, multiplications should always come before division.

## Impact
Tax is wrongly calculated leading to loss for the protocol
## POC
The following  calculations were made using chisel. you can compare the resuts from my refactored code to the actual code 

```solidity
➜ function calculateProtectedInterest(uint _utilizationRate) public pure returns (uint) {return (((_utilizationRate - 0.8 ether) * (100 - 8)) / (1 ether - 0.8 ether) + 8) * 100;}
➜ function calculateProtectedInterestRefactored(uint _utilizationRate) public pure returns (uint) {return (((_utilizationRate - 0.8 ether) * (100 - 8)) * 100) / (1 ether - 0.8 ether) + 800;}
//The calculations don't match for the following value

This will take more effecr in calculating compound factor leading to loss
## Code snippet
These is how the calculations for interest and compound factor is done.
```solidity
    function calculateProtectedInterest(uint _utilizationRate) public pure returns (uint interestRate_) {
        // If we haven't reached our kink, then we can just return the base fee
        if (_utilizationRate <= UTILIZATION_KINK) {
            // Calculate percentage increase for input range 0 to 0.8 ether (2% to 8%)
            interestRate_ = 200 + (_utilizationRate * 600) / UTILIZATION_KINK;
        }
        // If we have passed our kink value, then we need to calculate our additional fee
        else {
            // Convert value in the range 0.8 to 1 to the respective percentage between 8% and
            // 100% and make it accurate to 2 decimal places.
@>            interestRate_ = (((_utilizationRate - UTILIZATION_KINK) * (100 - 8)) / (1 ether - UTILIZATION_KINK) + 8) * 100;
        }
    }
```
The value of the `interestRate_` above is indirectly used in calculating the compound factor below.
```solidity
    function calculateCompoundedFactor(uint _previousCompoundedFactor, uint _utilizationRate, uint _timePeriod) public view returns (uint compoundedFactor_) {
        // Get our interest rate from our utilization rate
        uint interestRate = this.calculateProtectedInterest(_utilizationRate);

        // Ensure we calculate the compounded factor with correct precision. `interestRate` is
        // in basis points per annum with 1e2 precision and we convert the annual rate to per
        // second rate.
        uint perSecondRate = (interestRate * 1e18) / (365 * 24 * 60 * 60);

        // Calculate new compounded factor
   @>     compoundedFactor_ = _previousCompoundedFactor * (1e18 + (perSecondRate / 1000 * _timePeriod)) / 1e18;
          
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review
Foundry Chisel
## Recommendation
i have refactored both lines of code for efficiency 
```solidity
(((_utilizationRate - 0.8 ether) * (100 - 8)) * 100) / (1 ether - 0.8 ether) + 800;
```
the line of code above uses the distributive law of multiplication over addition and has reduced the impact of rounding errors
```solidity
compoundedFactor_ = _previousCompoundedFactor * (1e18 + (perSecondRate  * _timePeriod/1000)) / 1e18;
```
This also handles the rounding errors by carrying out multiplication before division
