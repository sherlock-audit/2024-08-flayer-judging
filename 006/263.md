# Rounding error may results in loss of small portion of compound factor change

## Summary

In the `TaxCalculator::calculateCompoundedFactor()` function, incorrect order of division can cause loss of small portion of compound factor change.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `TaxCalculator::calculateCompoundedFactor()`

```solidity
    function calculateCompoundedFactor(uint _previousCompoundedFactor, uint _utilizationRate, uint _timePeriod) public view returns (uint compoundedFactor_) {
        ... ...
        // Calculate new compounded factor
        compoundedFactor_ = _previousCompoundedFactor * (1e18 + (perSecondRate / 10000 * _timePeriod)) / 1e18;
    }
```

The `perSecondRate` is firstly divided by 10000 and then multiplied by `_timePeriod`.

Thus 4 decimal places of `perSecondRate` become zeros which would be a bigger loss after being multiplied by `_timePeriod`.

Consequently, this rounding error may cause loss of up to 0.00015% of actual compound factor change. (Can we actually treat 0.00015% as dust??? :-)

## Impact

The round error in compound factor calculation may cause some margin of unlocking price and health of a protected listing.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The `perSecondRate` should be multipled, then be divided by decimal places.

```diff
    function calculateCompoundedFactor(uint _previousCompoundedFactor, uint _utilizationRate, uint _timePeriod) public view returns (uint compoundedFactor_) {
        ... ...
-       compoundedFactor_ = _previousCompoundedFactor * (1e18 + (perSecondRate / 1000 * _timePeriod)) / 1e18;
+       compoundedFactor_ = _previousCompoundedFactor * (1e18 + (perSecondRate * _timePeriod / 10000)) / 1e18;
    }
```
