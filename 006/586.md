# Precision loss in compounded factor calculation will lower the interest accrued over time

### Summary

Due to division before multiplication, when calculating the current compounded factor in **TaxCalculator**#`calculateCompoundedFactor()` the value will be less than correct. However, due to the fact that the compounded factor could be checkpointed every block, this precision loss will keep occurring and will inevitably compound over time for every collection, making the protocol receive less interest on protected listings.


### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/TaxCalculator.sol#L80-L91
```solidity
    function calculateCompoundedFactor(uint _previousCompoundedFactor, uint _utilizationRate, uint _timePeriod) public view returns (uint compoundedFactor_) {
        // Get our interest rate from our utilization rate
        uint interestRate = this.calculateProtectedInterest(_utilizationRate);

        // Ensure we calculate the compounded factor with correct precision. `interestRate` is
        // in basis points per annum with 1e2 precision and we convert the annual rate to per
        // second rate.
        uint perSecondRate = (interestRate * 1e18) / (365 * 24 * 60 * 60);

        // Calculate new compounded factor
→       compoundedFactor_ = _previousCompoundedFactor * (1e18 + (perSecondRate / 1000 * _timePeriod)) / 1e18;
    }
```

As can be seen, when the current compound factor is calculated, `perSecondRate` is first divided by `1000` before multiplied by  `_timePeriod`. As a result the product `compoundedFactor_` will be lower than it must be. When `_createCheckpoint()` is called in the next block the same precision loss will occur and will compound.


### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Attack not required in this case.


### Impact

Every collection that has protected listings will accrue less interest than supposed to which will give borrowers a longer time frame to repay their loans or get them a free pass to not get liquidated when they are actually underwater.


### PoC

We can simply calculate the `compoundedFactor_` as is with the precision loss and then calculate it without the precision loss, then compound the error for a given period of time and compare the result.

$`compoundedFactor = \dfrac{previousCompoundFactor\ *\ (1e18 + \textcolor{red}{(perSecondRate\ / 1000 * \_timePeriod)})}{1e18}`$

**Where:**
$previousCompoundFactor = 1e18$
$`interestRate = 80e2\ (80\%)`$
$perSecondRate = \dfrac{interestRate * 1e18}{365 * 24 * 60 * 60} = \dfrac{80e2 * 1e18}{31 536 000} = 253678335870116$
$timePeriod = 14400\ (4\ hours)$

**Then**:

$compoundedFactor_1 = \dfrac{1e18 * \bigg(1e18 + \bigg(\Big(\dfrac{80e2 * 1e18}{31536000}\Big) / 1000 * 14400\bigg)\Bigg)}{1e18}$

$compoundedFactor_1 = \dfrac{1e18 * \big(1e18 + (253678335870116 / 1000 * 14400)\big)}{1e18}$

$compoundedFactor_1 = \dfrac{1e18 * 1003652968036528000}{1e18} = 1003652968036528000$


Now in the next compounded factor calculation, the only difference will be that $previousCompoundedFactor$ is not 1e18 but $compoundedFactor_1$.

$compoundedFactor_2 = \dfrac{compoundedFactor_1 * \bigg(1e18 + \bigg(\Big(\dfrac{80e2 * 1e18}{31536000}\Big) / 1000 * 14400\bigg)\Bigg)}{1e18}$

$compoundedFactor_2 = \dfrac{1003652968036528000 * 1003652968036528000}{1e18} = 1007319280248531895$


Let's calculate the compounded factor **without** the precision loss.

$`compoundedFactor = \dfrac{previousCompoundFactor\ *\ (1e18 + \textcolor{green}{(perSecondRate\ * \_timePeriod\ /\ 1000)})}{1e18}`$

$compoundedFactor_1 = \dfrac{1e18 * \bigg(1e18 + \bigg(\Big(\dfrac{80e2 * 1e18}{31536000}\Big) * 1440 / 10000\bigg)\Bigg)}{1e18}$

$compoundedFactor_1 = \dfrac{1e18 * \big(1e18 + (253678335870116 * 14400 / 1000)\big)}{1e18}$
$compoundedFactor_1 = 1003652968036529670$

The difference between the $compoundedFactor_1$ with precision loss and the one without is $1670$. When it compounds, the error margin will add up.

$compoundedFactor_2 = \dfrac{compoundedFactor_1 * \bigg(1e18 + \bigg(\Big(\dfrac{80e2 * 1e18}{31536000}\Big) * 14400 / 1000\bigg)\Bigg)}{1e18}$

$compoundedFactor_2 = \dfrac{1003652968036529670 * 1003652968036529670}{1e18}$

$`compoundedFactor_2 = 1007319280248535247`$ (now greater with $`3352`$ than the $`compoundedFactor_2`$ with precision loss)



We have not assessed for what values of `perSecondRate` and `_timePeriod` the precision loss would be higher so this must also be taken into account. The precision loss over one iteration of compounding is negligible **but** given this error will be present for the compound factors of all collections on Flayer and that the precision loss will vary depending on how often `_createCheckpoint()` is called and also depending the two parameters mentioned in the beginning (can be lower, but also can be higher), the cumulative sum of less accrued interest will now have an effect.
