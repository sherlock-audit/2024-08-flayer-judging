# Incorrect compound factor calculation

## Summary
Incorrect compound factor calculation will cause borrowers pay more borrow interest.

## Vulnerability Detail
When we calculate the latest compound factor, we will calculate the utilization and then calculate the accured compound factor in this time slot.
The return value in `calculateProtectedInterest` has two decimals, for example, APR is 8%, then the return value is 800.
The `perSecondRate` is `800 * 1e18 / year`
The calculated compound factor is `_previousCompoundedFactor * (1e18 + 800 *1e18/year/1000 * timeperiod )/1e18`
From the above formula, we can find that the calculate APR is 80%, not 8%.
The correct calculated compound factor should be `_previousCompoundedFactor * (1e18 + 800 *1e18/year/10000 * timeperiod )/1e18`

```solidity
    function calculateProtectedInterest(uint _utilizationRate) public pure returns (uint interestRate_) {
        // If we haven't reached our kink, then we can just return the base fee
        if (_utilizationRate <= UTILIZATION_KINK) {
            // Calculate percentage increase for input range 0 to 0.8 ether (2% to 8%)
            interestRate_ = 200 + (_utilizationRate * 600) / UTILIZATION_KINK;
        }
        // If we have passed our kink value, then we need to calculate our additional fee
        else {
            interestRate_ = (((_utilizationRate - UTILIZATION_KINK) * (100 - 8)) / (1 ether - UTILIZATION_KINK) + 8) * 100;
        }
    }
```
```solidity
    function calculateCompoundedFactor(uint _previousCompoundedFactor, uint _utilizationRate, uint _timePeriod) public view returns (uint compoundedFactor_) {
        // Get our interest rate from our utilization rate
        uint interestRate = this.calculateProtectedInterest(_utilizationRate);

        // Ensure we calculate the compounded factor with correct precision. `interestRate` is
        // in basis points per annum with 1e2 precision and we convert the annual rate to per
        // second rate.
        uint perSecondRate = (interestRate * 1e18) / (365 * 24 * 60 * 60);

@>        compoundedFactor_ = _previousCompoundedFactor * (1e18 + (perSecondRate / 1000 * _timePeriod)) / 1e18;
    }
```

## Impact
Borrowers have to pay a very high borrow rate.

## Recommendation
```diff
         // Calculate new compounded factor
-        compoundedFactor_ = _previousCompoundedFactor * (1e18 + (perSecondRate / 1000 * _timePeriod)) / 1e18;
+        // @audit 1000 is correct here ???
+        compoundedFactor_ = _previousCompoundedFactor * (1e18 + (perSecondRate / 10000 * _timePeriod)) / 1e18;
