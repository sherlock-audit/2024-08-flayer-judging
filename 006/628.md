# Possible precision loss while calculating `compoundedFactor_` in TaxCalculator.sol

## Summary
Possible precision loss while calculating `compoundedFactor_` in TaxCalculator.sol

## Vulnerability Detail

Solidity rounds down the result of an integer division, and because of that, it is always recommended to multiply before
dividing to avoid that precision loss. In the case of a prior division over multiplication, the final result may face serious precision loss as the first answer would face truncated precision and then multiplied to another integer.

The problem is in `calculateCompoundedFactor()`, it calculates compoundedFactor_ which is based on `perSecondRate`. But the issue is perSecondRate is already multiplied & divided. As result, when it is used for calculating compoundedFactor_, leads to precision loss.
```solidity
 function calculateCompoundedFactor(uint _previousCompoundedFactor, uint _utilizationRate, uint _timePeriod) public view returns (uint compoundedFactor_) {
        // Get our interest rate from our utilization rate
        uint interestRate = this.calculateProtectedInterest(_utilizationRate);

        // Ensure we calculate the compounded factor with correct precision. `interestRate` is
        // in basis points per annum with 1e2 precision and we convert the annual rate to per
        // second rate.
@>      uint perSecondRate = (interestRate * 1e18) / (365 * 24 * 60 * 60);

        // Calculate new compounded factor
@>      compoundedFactor_ = _previousCompoundedFactor * (1e18 + (perSecondRate / 1000 * _timePeriod)) / 1e18;
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Adjust `perSecondRate` in `compoundedFactor_`, such that there is no division before multiplication
