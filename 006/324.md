# Wrong division when adjusting `perSecondRate` in compounded factor calculation

### Summary

Due to dividing by a `1000` instead of `10000`, the `perSecondRate` will end up being 10 times bigger than it should be which will result in a orders of magnitude higher compounded factor causing loans' collateral to depreciate times quicker and cause users protected listings get liquidated sooner than expected. 


### Root Cause

When the compounded factor is calculated (in **TaxCalculator**#`calculateCompoundedFactor()`) the `perSecondRate` variable is **not** scaled down properly which causes a way higher final compounded factor.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/TaxCalculator.sol#L80-L91
```solidity
    function calculateCompoundedFactor(uint _previousCompoundedFactor, uint _utilizationRate, uint _timePeriod) public view returns (uint compoundedFactor_) {
        // Get our interest rate from our utilization rate
        uint interestRate = this.calculateProtectedInterest(_utilizationRate);

        // Ensure we calculate the compounded factor with correct precision. `interestRate` is
        // in basis points per annum with 1e2 precision and we convert the annual rate to per
        // second rate.
        uint perSecondRate = (interestRate * 1e18) / (365 * 24 * 60 * 60);

        // Calculate new compounded factor
→       compoundedFactor_ = _previousCompoundedFactor * (1e18 + (perSecondRate / 1000 * _timePeriod)) / 1e18;
    }
```

`perSecondRate` is an amount with 1e20 precision as `interestRate` is a number with a precision of $1e2$ (100), meaning 100% is `100_00` and **not** `10_00` and the comments above the function confirm that.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/TaxCalculator.sol#L53-L71
```solidity
    /**
     * ...
     * 
→    * @dev The interest rate is returned to 2 decimal places (200 = 2%)
     *
     * ...
     */
    function calculateProtectedInterest(uint _utilizationRate) public pure returns (uint interestRate_) {
        // If we haven't reached our kink, then we can just return the base fee
        if (_utilizationRate <= UTILIZATION_KINK) {
            // Calculate percentage increase for input range 0 to 0.8 ether (2% to 8%)
            interestRate_ = 200 + (_utilizationRate * 600) / UTILIZATION_KINK;
        }
        // If we have passed our kink value, then we need to calculate our additional fee
        else {
            // Convert value in the range 0.8 to 1 to the respective percentage between 8% and
            // 100% and make it accurate to 2 decimal places.
            interestRate_ = (((_utilizationRate - UTILIZATION_KINK) * (100 - 8)) / (1 ether - UTILIZATION_KINK) + 8) * 100;
        }
    }
```

Now coming back to the `perSecondRate` calculation:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/TaxCalculator.sol#L87
```solidity
        uint perSecondRate = (interestRate * 1e18) / (365 * 24 * 60 * 60);
```

We see that `interestRate` ($1e2$ precision), scaled by $1e18$ will result in a $1e20$ precision result. Meaning in `compoundedFactor_` calculation we have to scale it down by `100_00` (100%) to get the correct rate in 18 decimals precision before multiplying by `_timePeriod`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/TaxCalculator.sol#L90
```solidity
        compoundedFactor_ = _previousCompoundedFactor * (1e18 + (perSecondRate / 1000 * _timePeriod)) / 1e18;
```


### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

No additional action required, the protocol by itself will compound 10 times higher interest on protected listings.


### Impact

Compounded interest will be 10 times higher than intended, primarily affecting protected listings as they are subject to paying interest on loaned CollectionToken amounts.


### PoC

Let's express the formula that `calculateCompoundedFactor()` uses and evaluate it using some sample values:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/TaxCalculator.sol#L80-L91

$compoundedFactor = \dfrac{previousCompoundFactor\ *\ (1e18 + (perSecondRate\ / 1000 * timePeriod))}{1e18}$

**Where our sample values will be:**
$previousCompoundFactor = 1e18$
$interestRate = 80e2$ (80%)
$perSecondRate = \dfrac{interestRate * 1e18}{365 * 24 * 60 * 60} = \dfrac{80e2 * 1e18}{31 536 000} = 253678335870116$
$timePeriod = 1209600\ (14\ days)$

**Final equation becomes:**
$compoundedFactor = \dfrac{1e18 * (1e18 + \dfrac{\dfrac{80e2 * 1e18}{31536000}}{\textcolor{red}{10e2}} * 1209600)}{1e18}$

$compoundedFactor = \dfrac{1e18 * (1e18 + 253678335870 * 1209600)}{1e18}$

$compoundedFactor = \dfrac{1e18 * (1e18 + 306849315068352000)}{1e18}$

$compoundedFactor = \dfrac{1e18 * 1306849315068352000}{1e18}$

$compoundedFactor = 1.306849315068352000e18$

**But it actually should be:**
$compoundedFactor = \dfrac{1e18 * (1e18 + \dfrac{\dfrac{80e2 * 1e18}{31536000}}{\textcolor{green}{10e3}} * 1209600)}{1e18}$

$compoundedFactor = \dfrac{1e18 * (1e18 + 25367833587 * 1209600)}{1e18}$

$compoundedFactor = \dfrac{1e18 * 1030684931506835200}{1e18}$
$compoundedFactor = 1.030684931506835200e18$

**Or ~3% should have compounded for 2 weeks at interest rate of 80% instead of compounding 30%.**
