# Incorrect math in `TaxCalculator::calculateCompoundedFactor` will result in inaccurate fees

### Summary

The total fees deducted from the user's balance for lockbox deposits are calculated using a compounded interest rate, determined by the utilistation rate. While the interest rate is expressed in bps, as indicated by this comment from the function `TaxCalculator::calculateProtectedInterest`:
```javascript
@dev The interest rate is returned to 2 decimal places (200 = 2%)
```
The compounding factor, however, is calculated as if the interest rate were expressed with only one decimal place. This results in a compounding factor increase rate 10 times bigger.

### Root Cause

The math used in the calculation of the compounded factor in `TaxCalculator::calculateCompoundedFactor` is incorrect:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/TaxCalculator.sol#L90

```javascript
    function calculateCompoundedFactor(
        uint _previousCompoundedFactor,
        uint _utilizationRate,
        uint _timePeriod
    ) public view returns (uint compoundedFactor_) {
        // Get our interest rate from our utilization rate
        uint interestRate = this.calculateProtectedInterest(_utilizationRate);

        // Ensure we calculate the compounded factor with correct precision. `interestRate` is
        // in basis points per annum with 1e2 precision and we convert the annual rate to per
        // second rate.
        uint perSecondRate = (interestRate * 1e18) / (365 * 24 * 60 * 60);

        // Calculate new compounded factor
        //@audit basis points is 10000 not 1000
        compoundedFactor_ =
            (_previousCompoundedFactor *
  @>            (1e18 + ((perSecondRate / 1000) * _timePeriod))) /
            1e18;
    }
```
The `perSecondRate` should be divided by 10000 as it is expressed in bps.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

Lockbox deposits will be charged a much higher fee than what is intended.

### PoC

This function is tested in `TaxCalculator.t.sol::test_CanCompoundInterestInTaxCalculator`, however the `expectedFee` passed in `_assertCompound` is incorrectly set and should be 10 times smaller.

### Mitigation

Divide the per second rate by 10000 instead of 1000.
