# There is a calculation error inside the calculateCompoundedFactor() function, causing users to overpay interest.

## Summary
There is a calculation error inside the calculateCompoundedFactor() function, causing users to overpay interest.
## Vulnerability Detail
```javascript
    function calculateProtectedInterest(uint _utilizationRate) public pure returns (uint interestRate_) {
        // If we haven't reached our kink, then we can just return the base fee
        if (_utilizationRate <= UTILIZATION_KINK) {
            // Calculate percentage increase for input range 0 to 0.8 ether (2% to 8%)
@>>            interestRate_ = 200 + (_utilizationRate * 600) / UTILIZATION_KINK;
        }
        // If we have passed our kink value, then we need to calculate our additional fee
        else {
            // Convert value in the range 0.8 to 1 to the respective percentage between 8% and
            // 100% and make it accurate to 2 decimal places.
            interestRate_ = (((_utilizationRate - UTILIZATION_KINK) * (100 - 8)) / (1 ether - UTILIZATION_KINK) + 8) * 100;
        }
    }
```

```javascript
 function calculateCompoundedFactor(uint _previousCompoundedFactor, uint _utilizationRate, uint _timePeriod) public view returns (uint compoundedFactor_) {
        // Get our interest rate from our utilization rate
@>>        uint interestRate = this.calculateProtectedInterest(_utilizationRate);

        // Ensure we calculate the compounded factor with correct precision. `interestRate` is
        // in basis points per annum with 1e2 precision and we convert the annual rate to per
        // second rate.
       uint perSecondRate = (interestRate * 1e18) / (365 * 24 * 60 * 60);

        // Calculate new compounded factor
@>>         compoundedFactor_ = _previousCompoundedFactor * (1e18 + (perSecondRate / 1000 * _timePeriod)) / 1e18;
    }
```
Through the calculateProtectedInterest() function, which calculates the annual interest rate, we know that 200 represents 2% and 800 represents 8%, so the decimal precision is 4.
 When the principal is 100 and the annual interest rate is 2% (200), the yearly interest should be calculated as 100 * 200 / 10000 = 2. 

 However, in the calculateCompoundedFactor function, there is a clear error when calculating compound interest, as it only divides by 1000, leading to the interest being multiplied by a factor of 10.


## Impact
The user overpaid interest, resulting in financial loss.

```diff

        // Get our interest rate from our utilization rate
        uint interestRate = this.calculateProtectedInterest(_utilizationRate);

        // Ensure we calculate the compounded factor with correct precision. `interestRate` is
        // in basis points per annum with 1e2 precision and we convert the annual rate to per
        // second rate.
       uint perSecondRate = (interestRate * 1e18) / (365 * 24 * 60 * 60);

        // Calculate new compounded factor
-         compoundedFactor_ = _previousCompoundedFactor * (1e18 + (perSecondRate / 1000 * _timePeriod)) / 1e18;
+         compoundedFactor_ = _previousCompoundedFactor * (1e18 + (perSecondRate / 10000 * _timePeriod)) / 1e18;
    }
