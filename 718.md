# A reserved token listing cannot be unlocked.


## Summary
If a user reserves an ERC721 using `ProtectedListings::reserve` there is no functionality for the user to withdraw the ERC721.

## Vulnerability Detail
A reserved listing according to the documentation enables a user to place a reservation for an NFT untill they have enough tokens to purchase the NFT.
The `ProtectedListings::reserve` function lets a user place the reservation but there is no way a user can retrieve the NFT when they have gotten enough tokens to pay for the NFT.

## Impact
The collateral the user spent to place the reservation will be lost.
