# Potential for NFTs to Be Permanently Lost on L1.

## Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/moongate/src/InfernalRiftAbove.sol#L128

The smart contract processes deposits of NFTs to L2, but there is a critical flaw in the deposit mechanism where no validation checks are performed, when transferring NFTs, if the recipient address in `thresholdCross` or `_thresholdCross721` is not checked the NFTs won't be minted on L2 and it will stuck on L1 permanently.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `_mint` function of the NFT contract, a check ensures that the recipient is not address(0) before minting. However, the same check is not present in the earlier function calls when NFTs are being transferred to L2. 

In `thresholdCross`, the function transfers NFTs to the recipient, but there is no check to ensure that the recipient is not address(0), This issue is critical in [setTokenURIAndMintFromRiftAbove](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/moongate/src/libs/ERC721Bridgable.sol#L119-L129) where the _mint function is called with the recipient address passed as a parameter, If this recipient is address(0), the _mint function will revert due to the `require(to != address(0))` condition.


POC: 
```solidity
// This is L1
PORTAL.depositTransaction{value: msg.value}(
      INFERNAL_RIFT_BELOW, 0, params.gasLimit, false,
@>>>  abi.encodeCall(InfernalRiftBelow.thresholdCross, (package, params.recipient))
);

// This is L2
function thresholdCross(Package[] calldata packages, address recipient) external {
      if (package.amounts[0] == 0) {
@>>>      l2CollectionAddress = _thresholdCross721(package, recipient);
      } else {
          //...
      }
}

function _thresholdCross721(Package memory package, address recipient) internal returns(address l2CollectionAddress) {
    for (uint256 j; j < numIds; ++j) {
        if (l2Collection721.ownerOf(id) == address(this)) {
            l2Collection721.transferFrom(address(this), recipient, id);
        } else {
@>>>        l2Collection721.setTokenURIAndMintFromRiftAbove(id, package.uris[j], recipient);
        }
    }
}


function setTokenURIAndMintFromRiftAbove(uint _id, string memory _uri, address _recipient) external {
      // Mint the token to the specified recipient
@>>>  _mint(_recipient, _id);
}

function _mint(address to, uint256 id) internal virtual {
@>>>  require(to != address(0), "INVALID_RECIPIENT");
      //...
}
```

## Impact
if the recipient is incorrectly set to address(0) and the relay message fails, the NFTs will be permanently locked on the L2 network, 
making them irretrievable.

## Recommendation

```diff
function crossTheThreshold(ThresholdCrossParams memory params) external payable {
    //...
+   require(params.recipient != address(0), "recipient cannot be zero..."); 

    // Send package off to the portal
    PORTAL.depositTransaction{value: msg.value}(
        INFERNAL_RIFT_BELOW,
        0,
        params.gasLimit,
        false,
        abi.encodeCall(InfernalRiftBelow.thresholdCross, (package, params.recipient))
    );

    emit BridgeStarted(address(INFERNAL_RIFT_BELOW), package, params.recipient);
}
```
