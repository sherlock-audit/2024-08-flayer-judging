# If messages are received from multiple L1s, address conflicts occur.


## Summary
If messages are received from multiple L1s, address conflicts occur.

## Vulnerability Detail

When L2 receives a message from L1, if the contract corresponding to l1 does not exist, it clones `l2CollectionAddress` according to `l1CollectionAddress`:

```solidity
  function _thresholdCross721(Package memory package, address recipient) internal returns (address l2CollectionAddress) {
        ERC721Bridgable l2Collection721;

        address l1CollectionAddress = package.collectionAddress;
        l2CollectionAddress = l2AddressForL1Collection(l1CollectionAddress, false);

        // If not yet deployed, deploy the L2 collection and set name/symbol/royalty
        if (!isDeployedOnL2(l1CollectionAddress, false)) {
            Clones.cloneDeterministic(ERC721_BRIDGABLE_IMPLEMENTATION, bytes32(bytes20(l1CollectionAddress)));

            // Check if we have an ERC721 or an ERC1155
            l2Collection721 = ERC721Bridgable(l2CollectionAddress);
@>          l2Collection721.initialize(package.name, package.symbol, package.royaltyBps, package.chainId, l1CollectionAddress);

            // Set the reverse mapping
            l1AddressForL2Collection[l2CollectionAddress] = l1CollectionAddress;
        }
        ......
  }
```

Messages from L1 to L2 contain chainId(package.chainId), if multiple L1s send messages to L2, a conflict will occur on L2 if the `l1CollectionAddress` is the same.

The same ERC721 may use the same address on different L1s because they can all be deployed with the same developer's private key, and some projects may use the same address for ease of administration.

Different chainids should generate different `l2Collectionaddresses` on L2 to avoid address conflicts.

## Recommendation
```solidity
-    Clones.cloneDeterministic(ERC721_BRIDGABLE_IMPLEMENTATION, bytes32(bytes20(l1CollectionAddress)));
+    Clones.cloneDeterministic(ERC721_BRIDGABLE_IMPLEMENTATION, bytes32(bytes20(l1CollectionAddress) + package.chainId));
```
