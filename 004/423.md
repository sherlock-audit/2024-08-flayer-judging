# Users who modify their listings will pay more tax than they should, when modifying only the floorMultiplier

### Summary

The protocol allows users to modify their listing parameters by calling the [modifyListings()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L303-L384) function. However when the user doesn't want to update the duration of the listing, only the floorMultiple, he will pay more tax than he is supposed to. 
```solidity
            if (params.duration != 0) {
                // Ensure that the requested duration falls within our listing range
                if (params.duration < MIN_LIQUID_DURATION) revert ListingDurationBelowMin(params.duration, MIN_LIQUID_DURATION);
                if (params.duration > MAX_LIQUID_DURATION) revert ListingDurationExceedsMax(params.duration, MAX_LIQUID_DURATION);

                emit ListingExtended(_collection, params.tokenId, listing.duration, params.duration);

                listing.created = uint40(block.timestamp);
                listing.duration = params.duration;
            }
``` 
As can be seen from the above code snippet the duration, and the created values will only be updated if the user has specified a duration different than 0 in the params he provides to the [modifyListings()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L303-L384) function. When the new tax that the user owes is calculated
```solidity
taxRequired_ += getListingTaxRequired(listing, _collection);
```
It will be calculated for the whole duration of the listing, the fact that the time left of the listing is less is not taken into account. Which results in the user overpaying for tax. Consider the following scenario:
1. User A creates a position with a duration of **10 days**, and a floorMultiplier of **200** for a single NFT, the denomination of the token is **0**
2. 5 days pass and User A decides he has priced the NFT too high, and decides to modify the floorMultiplier to **150**
3. The tax the user initially paid is **~0.057e18** (based on the current formula for tax, whether that formula is correct or not is not important for this issue). After **5 days** have passed, the user will be returned **~0.0285e18** tokens, and the new tax that will be calculated will be **~0.032e18** because the contract calculates the tax for **10 days**, when there are only **5 days** left until the listing expires and turns into a dutch auction. The tax should be calculated for **5 days** and be **~0.016e18**
4. If the listing is bough in the same block after it was modified, User A will be witheld **5 days** worth of taxes from the new tax and will be refunded **~0.016e18**, instead of the **~0.032e18** tax he just paid.

This issue will occur every time  users only modify the floorMultiplier of their positions, if they increase the floorMultiplier  and for example the initial duration was 10 days, but before the user modifies his position he has 1 day left, he will pay much more tax than he should. This results in users loosing tokens when interacting with the system, thus the high severity. 

### Root Cause

When users modify their listings via the the [modifyListings()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L303-L384) function, the case where users may want to modify only the floorMultiplier is not fully considered. The new tax will be calculated based on the whole duration of the listing, the fact that there is less time left until the listing turns into a Dutch auction is disregarded.

### Impact

If users only modify the floorMultiplier they will pay more tax than they should.

After following the steps in the above mentioned [gist](https://gist.github.com/AtanasDimulski/95fe424bd5c38a08b7d12cc5c3911878) add the following test to the ``AuditorTests.t.sol`` file:

```solidity
    function test_ModifyListingTaxesMoreThanExpected() public {
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        collection1.mint(alice, 12);
        collection1.setApprovalForAll(address(listings), true);
        
        Listings.Listing memory listingAlice = IListings.Listing({
            owner: payable(alice),
            created: uint40(block.timestamp),
            duration: 10 days,
            floorMultiple: 200
        });

        uint256[] memory tokenIdsAlice = new uint256[](1);
        tokenIdsAlice[0] = 12;
        IListings.CreateListing[] memory createLisings = new IListings.CreateListing[](1);       
        IListings.CreateListing memory createListing = IListings.CreateListing({
                collection: address(collection1),
                tokenIds: tokenIdsAlice,
                listing: listingAlice
        });
        createLisings[0] = createListing;
        listings.createListings(createLisings);  
        uint256 taxWithledFromAlice = collectionTokenA.balanceOf(address(listings));
        console2.log("Tax collected from alice: ", taxWithledFromAlice);
        console2.log("Alice received tokens: ", collectionTokenA.balanceOf(alice));

        /// @notice 5 days pass, alice's NFT is not sold yet, so she decides to lower the price
        skip(5 days);
        collectionTokenA.approve(address(listings), type(uint256).max);

        Listings.ModifyListing memory modifiedListingAliceSingle = IListings.ModifyListing({
            tokenId: 12,
            duration: uint32(0),
            floorMultiple: 150
        });

        Listings.ModifyListing[] memory modifiedListingsAlice = new Listings.ModifyListing[](1);
        modifiedListingsAlice[0] = modifiedListingAliceSingle;
        listings.modifyListings(address(collection1), modifiedListingsAlice, false);
        console2.log("Alice balance after she decreased floorMultiplier: ", collectionTokenA.balanceOf(alice));
        IListings.Listing memory listingAfterModification = listings.listings(address(collection1), 12);
        console2.log("The created timesmap of the listing: ", listingAfterModification.created);
        /// @notice the duration is still 10 days, however since 5 days has passed the set price will hold only for 5 more days
        /// before the listing transforms into a dutch auction
        console2.log("The duration of the listing converted to days: ", listingAfterModification.duration / 86400);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

```solidity
Logs:
  Tax collected from alice:  57142857142857142
  Alice received tokens:  942857142857142858
  Alice balance after she decreased floorMultiplier:  939285714285714287
  The created timesmap of the listing:  1
  The duration of the listing converted to days:  10
