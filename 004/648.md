# ```Listings::modifyListings()``` doesn't update the ```listing.created``` (when only the ```floorMultiple``` is modified) leading to double paying and wrong accountings.

### Summary

Modifying only the ```floorMulitple``` of a ```Listing``` will mess up the accountings of the listing since the ```created``` parameter won't be updated leading to tax double-paying and wrong calculations.

### Root Cause

```Listings::modifyListings``` allows a lister to change the ```duration``` and/or the ```floorMultiple``` of his ```listing``` by resolving any tax from the start until this point and, basically, "restarting" the listing with these new conditions. However, there is a missing ```listing.created``` update when the ```floorMultiple``` is modified. Let's see this function :
```solidity
function modifyListings(address _collection, ModifyListing[] calldata _modifyListings, bool _payTaxWithEscrow) public nonReentrant lockerNotPaused returns (uint taxRequired_, uint refund_) {
        uint fees;

        for (uint i; i < _modifyListings.length; ++i) {
            // ...

            // Collect tax on the existing listing
            (uint _fees, uint _refund) = _resolveListingTax(listing, _collection, false);
            emit ListingFeeCaptured(_collection, params.tokenId, _fees);

            fees += _fees;
            refund_ += _refund;

            // Check if we are altering the duration of the listing
            if (params.duration != 0) {
                // Ensure that the requested duration falls within our listing range
                if (params.duration < MIN_LIQUID_DURATION) revert ListingDurationBelowMin(params.duration, MIN_LIQUID_DURATION);
                if (params.duration > MAX_LIQUID_DURATION) revert ListingDurationExceedsMax(params.duration, MAX_LIQUID_DURATION);

                emit ListingExtended(_collection, params.tokenId, listing.duration, params.duration);

@>                listing.created = uint40(block.timestamp);
@>                listing.duration = params.duration;
            }

            // Check if the floor multiple price has been updated
            if (params.floorMultiple != listing.floorMultiple) {
                // If we are creating a listing, and not performing an instant liquidation (which
                // would be done via `deposit`), then we need to ensure that the `floorMultiple` is
                // greater than 1.
                if (params.floorMultiple <= MIN_FLOOR_MULTIPLE) revert FloorMultipleMustBeAbove100(params.floorMultiple);
                if (params.floorMultiple > MAX_FLOOR_MULTIPLE) revert FloorMultipleExceedsMax(params.floorMultiple, MAX_FLOOR_MULTIPLE);

                emit ListingFloorMultipleUpdated(_collection, params.tokenId, listing.floorMultiple, params.floorMultiple);

@>                listing.floorMultiple = params.floorMultiple;
            }

            // Get the amount of tax required for the newly extended listing
@>            taxRequired_ += getListingTaxRequired(listing, _collection);
        }
        // ...

        // ...
   }
```

As we can see, when the ```floorMultiple``` is updated, the ```listing.created``` is not. This will make the user (who has already paid tax from start until this moment with ```fees``` variable) to pay for tax again from the start of the ```listing``` until the end of it but this time with the new ```floorMultiple```. 

This shouldn't be the case because the tax from start until now has been resolved and has been calculated with the previous ```floorMultiple``` and has been paid. The new ```floorMultiple``` should be taken into consideration from now until the end of the ```listing```, not from the start until the end.



### Internal pre-conditions

1. User opens a ```Listing``` for his token specifying a ```floorMultiple``` and a ```duration```.

### External pre-conditions

1. User wants to modify the ```floorMultiple``` (meaning the price) of this ```Listing``` and calls ```Listings::modifyListings()```.

### Attack Path

1. User calls ```Listings::createListings()``` and creates a ```listing``` with a specified ```floorMultiple``` and ```duration``` and prepays the tax until the end of the duration of his listing.
2. Some time passes. 
3. User, now, calls ```Listings::modifyListings()``` wanting to update the ```floorMultiple```. He, actually pays, for the tax with the previous ```floorMultiple``` from the start until now and the rest tax is refunded to him. However, with the missing ```created``` update, he again "prepays" from the start until the end with the new ```floorMultiple```.

### Impact

The impact of this critical vulnerability is that the user is forced to double pay the tax from the start of the ```listing``` until the moment of the modifying of ```floorMultiple```. One time with the previous ```floorMultiple``` (which is fair) and second time with the new ```floorMultiple``` which shouldn't be the case. Except from that, in all calculations from now, this new ```floorMultiple``` will be incorrectly assumed that it was the one from the very start. This will cause **loss of funds** for the user who is willing to modify the ```floorMultiple``` of his ```listing``` and, also, will, totally, mess up the internal accountings of corresponding ```collectionToken```.

### PoC

No PoC needed.

### Mitigation

To mitigate this vulnerability, make sure to update ```created``` as well, upon ```Listings::modifyListings```
