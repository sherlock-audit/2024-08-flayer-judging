# Tax calculations charge liquid listings unfairly

## Summary
Calculate tax will return overly-inflated values for `liquid` listings the longer they are, causing tax to be unreasonably high and potentially reverting `Listings.createListings` even at some sensible values.
## Vulnerability Detail
Currently, `calculateTax` uses a formula that uses calculations on a per-week basis.

```solidity
        taxRequired_ = (_floorMultiple ** 2 * 1e12 * _duration) / 7 days;
```
This implementation works fine for `dutch` listings as they have a MIN-MAX duration range set from 1 days to (7 days - 1).  
However in the case of `liquid` listings whose durations range from 7 days to 180 days, the tax will increase exponentially, either taxing users unreasonably high amounts of money or reverting the transaction due to the snippet below

```solidity
            taxRequired = getListingTaxRequired(listing.listing, listing.collection) * tokensIdsLength;
            if (taxRequired > tokensReceived) revert InsufficientTax(tokensReceived, taxRequired);
```
To put that in numbers:  
| Duration | Max Floor Multiple at Duration | Tax |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 180 days | 197 | 99,78% |
| 18 days | 1000 | ~97,78% |
| 77 days | 400 | 99,78% |

The numbers for reference were chosen to highlight 3 scenarios:  
1) A liquid listing set at MAX_LIQUID_DURATION can have a max floor multiple of 197, meaning a listing created at this duration is always at a loss since owner receives only the difference between FILL_PRICE and the floor value of the token
```solidity
            ownerReceives = _tload(FILL_PRICE) - (ownerIndexTokens * 1 ether * 10 ** _collectionToken.denomination());
```  
2) Users who want to list their rare NFT at MAX_FLOOR_MULTIPLE = 10_00 can list it for at-most ~18 days  

3) Users who want to list at the floor multiple used by liquidating protected listings = 400 can do it for at most 77 days (chose this floor multiple since it was picked by the developers as reasonable one for liquidation listings)  

All durations above the provided ones will cause reverts as tax will go beyond 100%.  

## Impact
1) Unreasonably high taxes  
2) `createListings` will revert even with sensible values 
3) Lack of profitable `liquid` listings at MAX_LIQUID_DURATION would either lose users value (if they happen to create one) or drive users away from engaging with the protocol

## Recommendation
Consider adding separate logic and formulas for `dutch` and `liquid` listing tax calculations.
