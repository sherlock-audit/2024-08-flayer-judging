# Unable to cancel an NFT whose tax exceeds the floor price

## Summary

An NFT may become non-cancellable if the tax exceeds the floor price (`1e18 * 10 ** denomination`) after modifying the listing.

## Vulnerability Detail

Creating a listing ensures that the tax on an NFT does not exceed the floor price. ([contracts/Listings.sol#L150](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L150))

```solidity
    function createListings(CreateListing[] calldata _createListings) public nonReentrant lockerNotPaused {
        .... ...

        // Loop over the unique listing structures
        for (uint i; i < _createListings.length; ++i) {
            ... ...

            // Get the amount of tax required for the newly created listing
            taxRequired = getListingTaxRequired(listing.listing, listing.collection) * tokensIdsLength;
            if (taxRequired > tokensReceived) revert InsufficientTax(tokensReceived, taxRequired);
            ... ...
        }
    }
```

However, the `Listings::modifyListings()` function does not enforce this restriction, so a listing owner can freely set the floor multiple and the duration of the listing as long as he provides the tax.

This provides the possibility that the tax can exceed the floor price.

The `Listings::cancelListings()` function burns the collection tokens that would have been given to the user when it was initially created.

```solidity
    function cancelListings(address _collection, uint[] memory _tokenIds, bool _payTaxWithEscrow) public lockerNotPaused {
        ... ...
@>      uint requiredAmount = ((1 ether * _tokenIds.length) * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination()) - refund;
        ... ...
    }
```

Therefore, as can be seen from the above line, the underflow revert may occur when `refund` is greater than the floor price.

Then, is it possible that a tax becomes greater than the floor price?

Of course. Let's take a example:

Assume that the duration is `70 days` and the floor multiple is `800`. (This assumption is easily feasible, as the maximum duration is `180 days` and the maximum floor multiple is `1e3`.)

Then the calculated tax via `TaxCalculator::calculateTax()` is `(500 ** 2 * 1e12 * 70 days) / 7 days = 2.5e5 * 1e12 * 10 = 2.5e18`.

### Proof-Of-Concept

Here's a proof test case in the `Listings.t.sol` file:

```solidity
    // @audit-poc
    function test_UncancellableDueToOverTaxed() public {
        uint256 _tokenId = 1;
        address _owner = address(0x101);
        uint16 _floorMultiple = 800;
        address _collection = address(erc721a);
        ICollectionToken token = locker.collectionToken(_collection);

        erc721a.mint(_owner, _tokenId);

        vm.startPrank(_owner);
        erc721a.approve(address(listings), _tokenId);
        _createListing({
            _listing: IListings.CreateListing({
                collection: address(erc721a),
                tokenIds: _tokenIdToArray(_tokenId),
                listing: IListings.Listing({
                    owner: payable(_owner),
                    created: uint40(block.timestamp),
                    duration: VALID_LIQUID_DURATION,
                    floorMultiple: _floorMultiple
                })
            })
        });

        deal(address(token), _owner, 10 ether);
        token.approve(address(listings), type(uint256).max);

        _modifyListing(
            _collection,
            _tokenId,
            70 days,
            800
        );

        vm.expectRevert(stdError.arithmeticError);
        listings.cancelListings(_collection, _tokenIdToArray(_tokenId), true);

        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

Here are the successful logs of the test case:

## Impact

NFTs whose taxes exceed the floor price are unable to cancel.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

A new listing in the `modifyListings()` function should be validated so that its tax never exceeds the floor price like in creating listings.
