# User will pay more taxes than they should when they modify an existing listings floor multiple

### Summary

In `Listings.modifyListings()` it will calculate the new tax as if the listing's creation timestamp was reset which will cause the user to pay more fees than they should.

### Root Cause

In `Listings.sol:355` it calculates the new tax for the modified listing. If the user only modified the floor multiple, the listing's `created` timestamp and `duration` will be the same. Thus the new tax is calculated as if it will run with the new floor multiple for the whole duration.

But, `block.timestamp > created`. It will only be live for `duration - (block.timestamp - created)`.

Thus, the tax will be higher than it should be:

```sol
    function calculateTax(address _collection, uint _floorMultiple, uint _duration) public pure returns (uint taxRequired_) {
        // If we have a high floor multiplier, then we want to soften the increase
        // after a set amount to promote grail listings.
        if (_floorMultiple > FLOOR_MULTIPLE_KINK) {
            _floorMultiple = FLOOR_MULTIPLE_KINK + ((_floorMultiple - FLOOR_MULTIPLE_KINK) / 2);
        }

        // Calculate the tax required per second
        taxRequired_ = (_floorMultiple ** 2 * 1e12 * _duration) / 7 days;
    }
```  

### Internal pre-conditions

none

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. User calls `modifyListings()` and only changes the listing's `floorMultiple`.

### Impact

The user pays more taxes than they should if they only increase a listing's floor multiple.

### PoC

none

### Mitigation

The new tax should be calculated only for the remaining duration. This makes the refund calculation more complicated.
