# Users will be unable to cancel modified listings in certain conditions

### Summary

The calculation of collection token tax amount based on the assumption that refund will be less than floor price can cause a revert due to underflow when cancelling listings for users. This occurs as the contract attempts to recover tokens during withdrawal, especially when listings are modified to have much higher taxes than initially allowed.


### Root Cause

When a listing is modified, the contract recalculates the tax:
```solidity
taxRequired_ += getListingTaxRequired(listing, _collection);
```
However, unlike during the initial listing creation, there's no check to ensure that this new tax doesn't exceed the floor price:
```solidity
// This check exists in createListings but not in modifyListings
if (taxRequired > tokensReceived) revert InsufficientTax(tokensReceived, taxRequired);
```
This allows a situation where the tax can grow larger than the floor price. The cancelListings function, however, assumes this invariant still holds when it calculates the amount to be recovered from user in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L451

```solidity
uint requiredAmount = ((1 ether * _tokenIds.length) * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination()) - refund;
```
If the refund (based on the inflated tax) is larger than the floor price, this calculation will underflow, causing the transaction to revert and preventing the cancellation of the listing.

The discrepancy between the lack of enforcement during modification and the assumption during cancellation is the root of this issue, leading to the underflow and subsequent revert.

### Attack Path

1. User creates a listing with a valid tax amount (less than floor price)
2. User modifies the listing, significantly increasing the duration or floor multiple
3. The modifyListings function recalculates the tax without checking if it exceeds the floor price:
`taxRequired_ += getListingTaxRequired(listing, _collection);`
4. User attempts to cancel the listing
5. In cancelListings, the contract attempts to calculate the required amount to burn:
`uint requiredAmount = ((1 ether * _tokenIds.length) * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination()) - refund;`
6. This calculation underflows as the refund (based on the high tax) can exceed the floor price
7. The transaction reverts due to the underflow, preventing the cancellation

### Impact

The user cannot cancel their listing due to the transaction reverting, potentially locking their asset indefinitely in the contract. This could lead to significant financial losses if market conditions change unfavorably. The workaround of modifying the listing to reduce the tax is ineffective as it forces the user to potentially list temporarily at unfavorable terms and still resulting in financial loss due to additional steps required. This breaks a core contract functionality that users may also not be aware of the workaround  for and the issue is primarily because of incorrect  assumptions in the protocol.
