# due to wrong math the user have to pay  more when canceling

### Summary

in listing.cancellistings    line 451  when calculating the value that the user have to return 
        uint **requiredAmount** = ((1 ether * _tokenIds.length) * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination()) - refund;
 it is subtracting     refund from ((1 ether * _tokenIds.length) * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination())   since the refund is less than the tax that the user paid when listing **requiredAmount ** will be more than the actual amount that the user received as a base payment  when  listing  so the user will have to pay  more than he recived 

### Root Cause

in listing.sol: line 451  it is subtracting refund from  the base
