# Double fee charged on price modification of a liquid listing

## Summary
Likelihood: medium, when the lister wants to increase the price multiplier without change in duration
Issue: When lister modifies the multiplier, the fee is charged at previous multiplier between (listing creation and listing modification). But after modification, any other action like cancel/fill listing will charge the fees at an updated multiplier for the whole time (listing creation and cancel/filling time) instead of time between (listing modification and cancel/filling time).

This is double charging, so users are discouraged from updating their floor multiplier prices. And also double charging is not the protocol's intended way of listing modification.

## Vulnerability Detail

Issue flow :
1. User creates a liquid listing for 10 days at 200 multipliers and it gets taxed 0.4 ether and he gets 0.96 etehr.
2. And 7.5 days are over, seeing a sudden spike in interest in the collection, he tries to modify the listing multiplier( price) only, but not the duration. Its is possible and allowed as a feature. Check line 271 below.
4. SO multiplier is changed from 200 to 400. And the new tax required is `taxRequired_` = 0.08 ether. Double than previous multiple.
5. Here, fees for listing before modification is 0.03 ether and refund is 0.01 ether. (75% of the duration is over), so 75% of 0.04 tax is used as fees and rest is called refund.
6. So, line 350 `taxRequired_ - refund_` = 0.08 - 0.01 = 0.07 etehr is pulled from user. And on line 361, the 0.03 ether fees is deposited for uniswap pool donation.

The issue is, when the user wants to cancel the listing at the end before 10th day duration or when filling, the is calculated again for the whole 10 days at the multiplier 400. So, this is a double fee charge, for 7.5 days at 200 multiplier, the lister paid 0.03 ether as fees for donation. And again when it gets filled/canceled, the whole tax at 400 multiplier for total 10 days duration is charged.

This is double fee charge, imagine if 0.03 ether was not charged because after modification, it gets filled/canceled and in that time the whole tax of 0.08 ether is charged right. Or correct way should be, when only multiplier is updated, pay fee for prev multiplier till the time of modification and pay for the new multiplier from modification time to duration end.

## Impact
The more times listing's multiplier is modified without duration, the extra fees charged.
This is double charging, so users are discouraged from updating their floor multplier prices. And also double charging is not the procol's intended way of listing modification.

Update the creation time of the listing to current timestamp on the else block where its checked if multiplier is changed.
In this case, only the fees is charged for remaining duration at modified multiplier, oer lese its gonna charge for whole duration.
