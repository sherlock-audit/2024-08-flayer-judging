# The formula used in the calculateTax() leads to price discrepancies and listings with certain parameters can't be created

### Summary

When users create a listing via the [createListings()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L130-L166) function they are withheld tax, this tax is calculated in the [getListingTaxRequired()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L766-L772) function based on the floorMultiplier provided by the user. The [getListingTaxRequired()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L766-L772) function internally calls the [calculateTax()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/TaxCalculator.sol#L35-L44) function:
```solidity
    function calculateTax(address _collection, uint _floorMultiple, uint _duration) public pure returns (uint taxRequired_) {
        // If we have a high floor multiplier, then we want to soften the increase
        // after a set amount to promote grail listings.
        if (_floorMultiple > FLOOR_MULTIPLE_KINK) {
            _floorMultiple = FLOOR_MULTIPLE_KINK + ((_floorMultiple - FLOOR_MULTIPLE_KINK) / 2);
        }

        // Calculate the tax required per second
        taxRequired_ = (_floorMultiple ** 2 * 1e12 * _duration) / 7 days;
    }
```
The [MIN_LIQUID_DURATION](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L82) is **7 days**, and the [MAX_LIQUID_DURATION](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L83C28-L83C47) is **180 days**. Now because the above function divides by **7 days**, a lot of combinations between floorMultiplier and duration for liquid listings wont' be possible. Because the [createListings()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L130-L166) function will revert due to the following check:
```solidity
if (taxRequired > tokensReceived) revert InsufficientTax(tokensReceived, taxRequired);
``` 
Lets take for example a floorMultiplier of **200**, and a duration of **180 days** we get the following:
 **(200 ** 2 * 1e12 * 15_552_000) / 604_800 = (40_000 * 1e12 * 15_552_000) / 604_800 = (4e16 * 15_552_000) / 604_800 = 622_080e18 / 604_800 ~1.02e18**
 The tax required will be bigger than 1e18 and thus the [createListings()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L130-L166) function will revert. This combination of parameters for a listing are in the expected parameters that users can provide, because they satisfy the limitations set as constant variables by the protocol team. There are a lot of combinations of floorMultiple and duration where a listing can't be be created, when it should be possible to create such a listing. The demonstrated scenario is not an edge case. The logical and simplest fix to that would be do divide by **365 days** not **7 days**. **7 days** seems like a completely random number. Secondly when dividing by **7 days** instead of **365 days** it looks like the users will have to pay more tax than they should. 

Another issue with the current formula is that this calculation is rounded down:
```solidity
((_floorMultiple - FLOOR_MULTIPLE_KINK) / 2);
```
The current price of the NFT is calculated in the [getListingPrice()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L826-L885) function:
```solidity
uint totalPrice = (price_ * uint(listing.floorMultiple)) / MIN_FLOOR_MULTIPLE;
```
Consider that the listing is a liquid listing, and it hasn't expired yet. Now lets consider that Alice and Bob both create a listing for a token of the same NFT collection, and both create a listing for 7 days.
 - Alice sets the floorMultiplier to **201**, now using the current formula she will have to pay **0.04e18** tax but the price of her NFT will be **(1e18 * 201) / 100 = 2.01e18** 
 - Bob sets the floorMultiplier to **200** for his NFT, with the current formula he will have to pay **0.04e18** tax as well. However his NFT will be priced at **(1e18 * 200) / 100 = 2.00e18**
 
If both NFTs are sold at the same time alice will receive 1% more tokens than bob, due to the above mentioned rounding issue. This lead to a price discrepancy in a lot of situations, which leads to the protocol receiving less fees than it should. 

The formula for calculating the tax is completely different from the formula described in the docs:

. Note that this formula doesn't make much sense either. 

### Root Cause

The implementation of the formula for calculating tax in the [calculateTax()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/TaxCalculator.sol#L35-L44) function is not optimal and introduces a couple of problems described above.

The implementation of the formula for calculating tax in the [calculateTax()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/TaxCalculator.sol#L35-L44) function leads to the [createListings()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L130-L166) function reverting in some cases, probably taxing users more than it  should, and creates a  price discrepancy which leads to the protocol loosing fees.
