# Wrong tax calculation in `createListings`

## Summary
In the `createListings` function in the `Listings.sol` contract the tax calculation is wrong as it is not multiplied by the duration.
## Vulnerability Detail
When we check out the tax calculation in `TaxCalculator.sol` we see that the tax is calculated the following way:
```solidity
 // Calculate the tax required per second
        taxRequired_ = (_floorMultiple ** 2 * 1e12 * _duration) / 7 days;
```
And the returned value by the `calculateTax` function is the tax required per second.
However in the `createListings` the tax is firstly multiplied by the denominator:
```solidity
function getListingTaxRequired(Listing memory _listing, address _collection) public view returns (uint taxRequired_) {
        // Send our listing information to our {TaxCalculator} to calculate
        taxRequired_ = locker.taxCalculator().calculateTax(_collection, _listing.floorMultiple, _listing.duration);

        // Add our token denomination to support meme tokens
>>>        taxRequired_ *= 10 ** locker.collectionToken(_collection).denomination();
    }
```
And then by the amount of NFTs:
```solidity
// Get the amount of tax required for the newly created listing
            taxRequired = getListingTaxRequired(listing.listing, listing.collection) * tokensIdsLength;
```
After that is is removed from the received amount:
```solidity
 if (taxRequired > tokensReceived) revert InsufficientTax(tokensReceived, taxRequired);
            unchecked { tokensReceived -= taxRequired; }
```

## Impact
Every time a listing is created the tax is calculated in a wrong way.
