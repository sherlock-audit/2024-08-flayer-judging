# Lack of Validation for Recipient Address in `InfernalRiftBelow`

## Summary
The `thresholdCross` function and its related internal functions `(_thresholdCross721, _thresholdCross1155)` fail to validate the `recipient address`. This can lead to tokens being sent to invalid addresses, resulting in a permanent loss of assets. Validation of the recipient address should be implemented to avoid this issue.


## Vulnerability Detail
The contract allows for the transfer of `ERC721` and `ERC1155` tokens using the `thresholdCross` function, where the recipient address is passed as an argument. However, there is no check to ensure that the recipient address is valid or non-zero. If an invalid address is provided , tokens could be lost permanently, as they would be sent to a non-recoverable address. This is particularly risky in cross-chain transfers or bridging mechanisms.


## Impact
Tokens can be transferred to invalid addresses, leading to a permanent loss of assets. Since the contract is designed to handle cross-chain transfers, losing tokens in such a manner could severely impact the security and functionality of the system.
