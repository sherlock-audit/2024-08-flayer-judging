# Differences between ZKSync and Ethereum in handling contract deployment and address calculation

## Summary
Differences between ZKSync and Ethereum in handling contract deployment and address calculation
## Vulnerability Detail
According to the requirements of the project, this contract will be deployed on the l2 chain, which involves the create operation code. This is a problem in the zk network.

On Ethereum, it can be safely determined using the formula hash(RLP[address, nonce]). However, on ZKsync, it is advisable to wait until the contract is deployed and catch the ContractDeployed event emitted by the [ContractDeployer](https://docs.zksync.io/build/developer-reference/era-contracts/system-contracts), which provides the address of the newly deployed contract. The SDK handles all of these processes in the background to simplify the workflow.

```solidity

        // Deploy our new ERC20 token using Clone. We use the impending ID
        // to clone in a deterministic fashion.
        ICollectionToken collectionToken_ = ICollectionToken(
            LibClone.cloneDeterministic(tokenImplementation, bytes32(_collectionCount))
        );
```
```solidity
    /// @dev Deploys a deterministic clone of `implementation` with `salt`.
    /// Deposits `value` ETH during deployment.
    function cloneDeterministic(uint256 value, address implementation, bytes32 salt)
        internal
        returns (address instance)
    {
        /// @solidity memory-safe-assembly
        assembly {
            mstore(0x21, 0x5af43d3d93803e602a57fd5bf3)
            mstore(0x14, implementation)
            mstore(0x00, 0x602c3d8160093d39f33d3d3d3d363d3d37363d73)
            instance := create2(value, 0x0c, 0x35, salt)
            if iszero(instance) {
                mstore(0x00, 0x30116425) // `DeploymentFailed()`.
                revert(0x1c, 0x04)
            }
            mstore(0x21, 0) // Restore the overwritten part of the free memory pointer.
        }
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use reliable deployment tools and SDKs: For example, ensure that the ZKSync SDK or similar tools handle contract bytecode correctly.
