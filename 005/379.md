# `swapFeeOverride` and fee exemption feature  becomes unused all the time

## Summary
Impact: Users who can have fee overridden/exempted will also get charged with the same pool fee like everyone.
root cause: wrong validation on line 692

## Vulnerability Detail

Issue flow:
1. Owner sets a fee of 10000 on `setFeeExemption` call and line 719 will store `1000 << 24 | 0xFFFFFF` = `0x3e8ffffff`
2. Then someone calls swap and before swap hook calls `getFee` to calculate the swap fee and this fee will be `poolfee` for everyone and if the _sender is overridden with `feeOverrides`, then `baseSwapFeeOverride` value will be the fees on line 697.

But on line 692, it is checking if `swapFeeOverride & 0xFFFFFF == 1` which will never be 1 because `0x3e8ffffff` was the swapFeeOverride, and   `0x3e8ffffff & 0xFFFFFF = 0xFFFFFF` but not equal to 1. So even if owner sets the fee override to sender, it cannot be applied because line 692 skips. It's supposed to be `swapFeeOverride & 0xFFFFFF == 0xFFFFFF`, not == 1.

684:         if (poolFee != 0) {
685:             fee_ = poolFee;
686:         }

690:         uint48 swapFeeOverride = feeOverrides[_sender];
692:  >>>    if (uint24(swapFeeOverride & 0xFFFFFF) == 1) {
695:             uint24 baseSwapFeeOverride = uint24(swapFeeOverride >> 24);
696:             if (baseSwapFeeOverride < fee_) {
697:                 fee_ = baseSwapFeeOverride;
698:             }
699:         }
700:     }

710:     function setFeeExemption(address _beneficiary, uint24 _flatFee) public onlyOwner {
---- SNIP ----
719:   >>>   feeOverrides[_beneficiary] = uint48(_flatFee) << 24 | 0xFFFFFF;
720:         emit BeneficiaryFeeSet(_beneficiary, _flatFee);
721:     }

```


## Impact
`feeOverrides[_sender]` for a sender can never be put to accounting and all the senders will get `poolFee` even if they has fee exemptions. And owner wants some senders to have 0 fees charged, which is not possible due to wrong validation on line 692.
