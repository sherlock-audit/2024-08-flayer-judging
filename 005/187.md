# Fee exemptions do not work since incorrect value is packed in `feeOverrides` storage

### Summary

The swap fee override expects a value of 1 in the first 24 bits of `feeOverrides` mapping but the admin sets it to maxUint24. Swap fee overrides never work because of this.

### Root Cause

When an admin sets the fee exemption, the value packed in the first 24 bits of the `feeOverrides` is `0xFFFFFF` or maxUint24 instead of 1. 
ref: [UniswapImplementation::setFeeExemption()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/UniswapImplementation.sol#L735-L738)
```solidity
    feeOverrides[_beneficiary] = uint48(_flatFee) << 24 | 0xFFFFFF;
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin [sets the fee exemption](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/UniswapImplementation.sol#L729-L740) to any value.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Admin [sets the fee exemption](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/UniswapImplementation.sol#L729-L740) to any value.
2. When a swap fee override is supposed to apply to a beneficiary, it does not and the default fee or pool fee will apply.

ref: [UniswapImplementation::getFee()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/UniswapImplementation.sol#L711-L718)
```solidity
      // @audit the first 24 bits is maxUint24 instead of 1 so the condition below will always fail even when the swapFeeOverride was set by an admin
      if (uint24(swapFeeOverride & 0xFFFFFF) == 1) {
          // We can then extract the original uint24 fee override and apply this, only if
          // it is less that then traditionally calculated base swap fee.
          uint24 baseSwapFeeOverride = uint24(swapFeeOverride >> 24);
          if (baseSwapFeeOverride < fee_) {
              fee_ = baseSwapFeeOverride;
          }
      }
```

### Impact

Beneficiaries of swap fee exemptions/overrides will not get their swap fee discounts.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider modifying `setFeeExemption()` to pack in the value of 1 instead of maxUint24.

```solidity
    feeOverrides[_beneficiary] = uint48(_flatFee) << 24 | 1;
```
