# `UniswapImplementation` sets fee exemption erroneously

### Summary

Function [UniswapImplementation::setFeeExemption](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/UniswapImplementation.sol#L738) employs the wrong constant:

```solidity
// We need to be able to detect if the zero value is a flat fee being applied to
// the user, or it just hasn't been set. By packing the `1` in the latter `uint24`
// we essentially get a boolean flag to show this.
feeOverrides[_beneficiary] = uint48(_flatFee) << 24 | 0xFFFFFF;
```

In the above, it should be `feeOverrides[_beneficiary] = uint48(_flatFee) << 24 | 0x000001;`


### Impact

Fee exemption is being set incorrectly, and subsequently can be neither applied in [getFee](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/UniswapImplementation.sol#L711) nor removed in [removeFeeExemption](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/UniswapImplementation.sol#L751-L754).

### PoC

This is witnessed by sponsor's own failing tests, such as `test_CanSetFeeExemption` or `test_CanRemoveFeeExemption`
