# A beneficiary will be unable to get the fee because of wrong implementation of `setFeeExemption()`

## Summary

A beneficiary will be unable to get the fee because of wrong implementation of `setFeeExemption()`

## Vulnerability Detail

According to the comment below([implementation/UniswapImplementation.sol#L722-L724](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/UniswapImplementation.sol#L722-L724)), once a beneficiary is set, the swap fee will be overwritten if the set fee exemption meets certain criteria.

> Set our beneficiary's flat fee rate across all pools. If a beneficiary is set, then the fee processed during a swap will be overwritten if this fee exemption value is lower than the otherwise determined fee.

And in the another following comment([implementation/UniswapImplementation.sol#L735-L737](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/UniswapImplementation.sol#L735-L737)), the latter 24 bits of `feeOverrides[_beneficiary]` should be set to 1 in order to apply the fee exemption.

> We need to be able to detect if the zero value is a flat fee being applied to the user, or it just hasn't been set. By packing the `1` in the latter `uint24` we essentially get a boolean flag to show this.

However, the [`setFeeExemption()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/UniswapImplementation.sol#L729-L740) function sets the lower 24 bits to `0xFFFFFF` instead of `0x01`, disabling the fee overrides from being applied.

```solidity
    function setFeeExemption(address _beneficiary, uint24 _flatFee) public onlyOwner {
        ... ...
@>      feeOverrides[_beneficiary] = uint48(_flatFee) << 24 | 0xFFFFFF;
        emit BeneficiaryFeeSet(_beneficiary, _flatFee);
    }
```

## Impact

The fee overrides can not be applied and only the default fee will work during a swap.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Should update the issued line like the below:

```diff
    function setFeeExemption(address _beneficiary, uint24 _flatFee) public onlyOwner {
        ... ...
-       feeOverrides[_beneficiary] = uint48(_flatFee) << 24 | 0xFFFFFF;
+       feeOverrides[_beneficiary] = uint48(_flatFee) << 24 | 0x01;
        emit BeneficiaryFeeSet(_beneficiary, _flatFee);
    }
```

After this update, I was able to successfully pass the `test_CanGetFeeWithExemptFees()` testcase.

```bash
$ forge test --match-test test_CanGetFeeWithExemptFees -vv
