# There is a logical error in the removeFeeExemption() function.


## Summary
There is a logical error in the removeFeeExemption() function, causing feeOverrides[_beneficiary] to never be removed.
## Vulnerability Detail
```javascript
   function removeFeeExemption(address _beneficiary) public onlyOwner {
        // Check that a beneficiary is currently enabled
@>>        uint24 hasExemption = uint24(feeOverrides[_beneficiary] & 0xFFFFFF);
@>>        if (hasExemption != 1) {
            revert NoBeneficiaryExemption(_beneficiary);
        }

        delete feeOverrides[_beneficiary];
        emit BeneficiaryFeeRemoved(_beneficiary);
    }
```
Through setFeeExemption(), we know that the lower 24 bits of feeOverrides[_beneficiary] are set to 0xFFFFFF. Therefore, the expression uint24 hasExemption = uint24(feeOverrides[_beneficiary] & 0xFFFFFF) results in 0xFFFFFF & 0xFFFFFF = 0xFFFFFF. As a result, hasExemption will never be 1, causing removeFeeExemption() to always revert. Consequently, feeOverrides[_beneficiary] will never be removed.
```javascript
function setFeeExemption(address _beneficiary, uint24 _flatFee) public onlyOwner {
        // Ensure that our custom fee conforms to Uniswap V4 requirements
        if (!_flatFee.isValid()) {
            revert FeeExemptionInvalid(_flatFee, LPFeeLibrary.MAX_LP_FEE);
        }

        // We need to be able to detect if the zero value is a flat fee being applied to
        // the user, or it just hasn't been set. By packing the `1` in the latter `uint24`
        // we essentially get a boolean flag to show this.
@>>        feeOverrides[_beneficiary] = uint48(_flatFee) << 24 | 0xFFFFFF;
        emit BeneficiaryFeeSet(_beneficiary, _flatFee);
    }
```

## Impact
Since feeOverrides[_beneficiary] cannot be removed, the user continues to receive reduced fee benefits, leading to partial fee losses for LPs and the protocol.
