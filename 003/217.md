# User can't claim royalties for bridged ERC1155 tokens

### Summary

`InternalRiftBelow` doesn't compute the ERC1155's l2 address correctly. That causes the `claimRoyalties()` function to revert for bridged ERC1155 contracts.

### Root Cause

When an ERC1155 token is bridged in [InfernalRiftBelow.sol:280](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/moongate/src/InfernalRiftBelow.sol#L280), the l2 address is computed using the ERC1155 implementation contract and the salt (l1 collection address):

```sol
Clones.cloneDeterministic(ERC1155_BRIDGABLE_IMPLEMENTATION, bytes32(bytes20(l1CollectionAddress)));
```

In `claimRoyalties` ([InfernalRiftBelow.sol:230](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/moongate/src/InfernalRiftBelow.sol#L230)) it calculates the L2 address for the given collection as if it was an ERC721 although it can also be a ERC1155 contract:

```sol
        ERC721Bridgable(l2AddressForL1Collection(_collectionAddress, false)).claimRoyalties(_recipient, _tokens);
        
            function l2AddressForL1Collection(address _l1CollectionAddress, bool _is1155) public view returns (address l2CollectionAddress_) {
        l2CollectionAddress_ = Clones.predictDeterministicAddress(
            _is1155 ? ERC1155_BRIDGABLE_IMPLEMENTATION : ERC721_BRIDGABLE_IMPLEMENTATION,
            bytes32(bytes20(_l1CollectionAddress))
        );
    }

```

Thus, when `claimRoyalties()` is called for an ERC1155 contract, the L2 address won't be computed correctly causing the tx to revert.
