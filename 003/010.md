# Users can steal the royalties of holders in the same collection who use the bridge

## Summary
The claimRoyalties function allows users to steal the royalties of the whole collection.
## Vulnerability Detail
When a user calls `claimRoyalties` on `InfernalRiftAbove`, a message is sent to the l2 `InfernalRiftBelow` contract. Then the `claimRoyalties` function will execute:
```solidity
  ERC721Bridgable(l2AddressForL1Collection(_collectionAddress, false)).claimRoyalties(_recipient, _tokens);
```
However when we check out the claimRoyalties function in the `ERC721Bridgable` we can see that all the balance of the collection that is currently being held in `ERC721Bridgable` will be transferred  to the recipient set by the original caller of the function:
```solidity
 for (uint256 i; i < tokensLength; ++i) {
            // Map our ERC20
            ERC20 token = ERC20(_tokens[i]);

            // If we have a zero-address token specified, then we treat this as native ETH
            if (address(token) == address(0)) {
                SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH(_recipient, payable(address(this)).balance);
            } else {
                SafeTransferLib.safeTransfer(token, _recipient, token.balanceOf(address(this)));
            }
```
As a result all the royalties for the whole collection will be transfered to one user.
## Impact
High as users will be able to steal royalties.
