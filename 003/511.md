# Royalties can only be collected by the `receiver` of the NFT with ID `0`

### Summary

_No response_

### Root Cause

The function [InfernalRiftAbove::claimRoyalties()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/moongate/src/InfernalRiftAbove.sol#L251) only allows the royalty `receiver` of the NFT with ID `0` to claim royalties for the whole collection:

```solidity
// We can now pull the royalty information from the L1 to confirm that the caller
// is the receiver of the royalties. We can't actually pull in the default royalty
// provider so instead we just use token0.
(address receiver,) = IERC2981(_collectionAddress).royaltyInfo(0, 0);

// Check that the receiver of royalties is making this call
if (receiver != msg.sender) revert CallerIsNotRoyaltiesReceiver(msg.sender, receiver);
```

This is problematic in collections where the `receiver` changes for each token ID because it allows the `reicever` of the token ID `0` to claim the royalty fees of all the other NFTs in the collection and prevents the righful receivers from collecting the royalty. This also assumes that an NFT with ID `0` exists in every collection, that a correct receiver is set for it and that `royaltyInfo()` will return a valid price for it. 

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. An ERC721 collection with royalties whose `receiver` changes depending on token ID

### Attack Path


1. Alice bridges NFT with ID `5` of collection `X` to L2 via [InfernalRiftAbove::crossTheThreshold()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/moongate/src/InfernalRiftAbove.sol#L83). She is the royalties `receiver` for this token
2. NFT `5` is sold on L2 and royalties paid to the `ERC721Bridgable` contract
3. Alice wants to claim her royalties but she can't because the royalties `receiver` of NFT with ID `0` is Bob

### Impact

In a bridged ERC721 collections with royalties whose `receiver` changes depending on token ID:

- The `receiver` of token ID `0` can steal other users royalties
- Other users won't be able to collect their royalties

### Mitigation

In [InfernalRiftAbove::claimRoyalties()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/moongate/src/InfernalRiftAbove.sol#L251) the `receiver` should be set based on the IDs of the tokens whose royalties are being claimed and the `receiver` should be the same address for all of them.
