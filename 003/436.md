# ERC1155 collection royalty fees cannot be claimed on L2

## Summary
ERC1155 collection royalty fees cannot be claimed on L2.

## Vulnerability Detail

An ERC1155 collection can be deployed as [ERC1155Bridgable](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/moongate/src/libs/ERC1155Bridgable.sol#L19) contract with royalty on L2 through moongate.

When the ERC1155 collection tokens are traded on marketplace, royalty fees is collected and accrued in the bridge contract. [claimRoyalties](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/moongate/src/libs/ERC1155Bridgable.sol#L116) can be called to claim royalty fees and the function can only be called by [InfernalRiftBelow](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/moongate/src/InfernalRiftBelow.sol#L26).

[ERC1155Bridgable.sol#L117-L119](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/moongate/src/libs/ERC1155Bridgable.sol#L117-L119):
```solidity
        if (msg.sender != INFERNAL_RIFT_BELOW) {
            revert NotRiftBelow();
        }
```

The ERC1155 collection royalty receiver is expected to send calls from [InfernalRiftAbove](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/moongate/src/InfernalRiftAbove.sol#L28) to claim royalty fees, when [claimRoyalties()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/moongate/src/InfernalRiftAbove.sol#L251) is called, a message will be sent from L1 to L2, and [claimRoyalties()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/moongate/src/InfernalRiftBelow.sol#L220) in `InfernalRiftBelow` is called to send accrued royalty fees to the L2 recipient of the royalties.

[InfernalRiftBelow.sol#L220-L232](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/moongate/src/InfernalRiftBelow.sol#L220-L232):
```solidity
    function claimRoyalties(address _collectionAddress, address _recipient, address[] calldata _tokens) public {
        // Ensure that our message is sent from the L1 domain messenger
        if (ICrossDomainMessenger(msg.sender).xDomainMessageSender() != INFERNAL_RIFT_ABOVE) {
            revert CrossChainSenderIsNotRiftAbove();
        }

        // Get our L2 address from the L1
        if (!isDeployedOnL2(_collectionAddress, false)) revert L1CollectionDoesNotExist();

        // Call our ERC721Bridgable contract as the owner to claim royalties to the recipient
        ERC721Bridgable(l2AddressForL1Collection(_collectionAddress, false)).claimRoyalties(_recipient, _tokens);
        emit RoyaltyClaimFinalized(_collectionAddress, _recipient, _tokens);
    }
```

However, as we can see from above, `claimRoyalties()` only supports **ERC721Bridgable**, since **ERC1155Bridgable** is not supported, the royalty fees accrued cannot be claimed.

## Impact

ERC1155 collection royalty fees cannot be claimed on L2, tokens are stucked in **ERC1155Bridgable** contract.

## Recommendation

Refactor to allow royalty receiver to claim ERC1155 collection royalty fees on L2.
