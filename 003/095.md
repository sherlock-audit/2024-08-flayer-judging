# Owner of Bridged ERC1155 Royalties can't claim them

### Summary

ERC1155 having royalties won't be claimed on bridged  ERC1155 Tokens

### Root Cause

```solidity
File: InfernalRiftBelow.sol
220:     function claimRoyalties(address _collectionAddress, address _recipient, address[] calldata _tokens) public {
221:         // Ensure that our message is sent from the L1 domain messenger
222:         if (ICrossDomainMessenger(msg.sender).xDomainMessageSender() != INFERNAL_RIFT_ABOVE) {
223:             revert CrossChainSenderIsNotRiftAbove();
224:         }
225: 
226:         // Get our L2 address from the L1
227:         if (!isDeployedOnL2(_collectionAddress, false)) revert L1CollectionDoesNotExist();
228: 
229:         // Call our ERC721Bridgable contract as the owner to claim royalties to the recipient
230:         ERC721Bridgable(l2AddressForL1Collection(_collectionAddress, false)).claimRoyalties(_recipient, _tokens);
231:         emit RoyaltyClaimFinalized(_collectionAddress, _recipient, _tokens);
232:     }
```

In line 227 we check if the collection is deployed on L2 for ERC721 only (by the false parameter passed)

So if the call was for ERC1155 royalties it will revert in 227

```solidity
File: InfernalRiftBelow.sol
92:     function isDeployedOnL2(address _l1CollectionAddress, bool _is1155) public view returns (bool isDeployed_) {
93:         isDeployed_ = l2AddressForL1Collection(_l1CollectionAddress, _is1155).code.length > 0; //@audit we call it here with `_is1155` as false
94:     }
```

But this will return false cause `code.length` will be < 0

Because:
in `l2AddressForL1Collection` we get the ERC721 implementation contract deployed with the ERC1155 l1 address bytes as salt

```solidity
File: InfernalRiftBelow.sol
77:     function l2AddressForL1Collection(address _l1CollectionAddress, bool _is1155) public view returns (address l2CollectionAddress_) {
78:         l2CollectionAddress_ = Clones.predictDeterministicAddress(
79:             _is1155 ? ERC1155_BRIDGABLE_IMPLEMENTATION : ERC721_BRIDGABLE_IMPLEMENTATION,
80:             bytes32(bytes20(_l1CollectionAddress))
81:         );
82:     }
```

But it will return an address that is not deployed and has 0 code length since we called `Clones.predictDeterministicAddress` With `ERC721_BRIDGABLE_IMPLEMENTATION` and `_l1CollectionAddress` which in our case is ERC1155

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

ERC1155 tokens bridged are having pending royalties waiting to be claimed 

### Attack Path

1. User bridge ERC1155 from L1 that supports royalties and royalties will be recorded in the `package` [Here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/moongate/src/InfernalRiftAbove.sol#L178) 
2. L2 contract deploy the `ERC1155Bridgable` that supports claiming royalities and set him self as the royalty owner
3. Tokens bridged accumulate royalties waiting to be claimed
4. royalty owner try to claim them from L1 contract and txn go throw
5. Txn in L2 will revert due the wrong check [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/moongate/src/InfernalRiftBelow.sol#L227) and there is no other function for claiming ERC1155 royalty

> **_Note!:_** According to token integration Question in the audit readMe
>> ERC721 and ERC1155 tokens will be supported. Additionally, the subset of those tokens that implement ERC-2981 for royalties will gain additional support for claiming.

So in addition to the impact its clearly violating the readMe

### Impact

Loss of funds (royalties) on L2 ERC1155 Tokens

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a check for ERC1155 deployed or build a logic from 0 to have seperate `claimRoyalty` functions for every token type on both contracts
