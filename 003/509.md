# If the royalties receiver it's a smart contract it might be impossible to collect L2 royalties

### Summary

_No response_

### Root Cause

The function [InfernalRiftAbove::claimRoyalties()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/moongate/src/InfernalRiftAbove.sol#L251) can only be called by the receiver of the royalties:

```solidity
(address receiver,) = IERC2981(_collectionAddress).royaltyInfo(0, 0);

// Check that the receiver of royalties is making this call
if (receiver != msg.sender) revert CallerIsNotRoyaltiesReceiver(msg.sender, receiver);
```

This is fine for EOAs but is problematic if `receiver` is a contract that doesn't have a way to call [InfernalRiftAbove::claimRoyalties()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/moongate/src/InfernalRiftAbove.sol#L251), as this would result in the `receiver` not being able to claim the royalties collected by NFTs bridged to L2.

### Impact

If the royalties `receiver` is a smart contract that doesn't have a way to call [InfernalRiftAbove::claimRoyalties()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/moongate/src/InfernalRiftAbove.sol#L251) it's impossible to claim the royalties, which will be stuck.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Allow royalties to be claimed to the `receiver` address by anybody when `receiver` is a smart contract.
