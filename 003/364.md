# Users cannot claim royalties for `ERC1155`

## Summary
Users can only claim L1 -> L2 royalties for ERC721 collections and cannot for ERC1155.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `InferanlRiftAbove` contract allows users to [claim their L1 royalties](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/moongate/src/InfernalRiftAbove.sol#L242-L274) against the L2 equivalent for collections that support the `EIP-2981` interface:

```solidity
    if (!IERC2981(_collectionAddress).supportsInterface(type(IERC2981).interfaceId)) revert CollectionNotERC2981Compliant();
```

Both ERC721 and ERC1155 [can accumulate royalties](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2981) and EIP2981 supports them, but once the message is received on L2, the [function flow](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/moongate/src/InfernalRiftBelow.sol#L220-L232) has only 1 case and that is for 721 tokens:

```solidity
    function claimRoyalties(address _collectionAddress, address _recipient, address[] calldata _tokens) public {
        // Ensure that our message is sent from the L1 domain messenger
        if (ICrossDomainMessenger(msg.sender).xDomainMessageSender() != INFERNAL_RIFT_ABOVE) {
            revert CrossChainSenderIsNotRiftAbove();
        }

        // Get our L2 address from the L1
@>      if (!isDeployedOnL2(_collectionAddress, false)) revert L1CollectionDoesNotExist();

        // Call our ERC721Bridgable contract as the owner to claim royalties to the recipient
        ERC721Bridgable(l2AddressForL1Collection(_collectionAddress, false)).claimRoyalties(_recipient, _tokens);
        emit RoyaltyClaimFinalized(_collectionAddress, _recipient, _tokens);
    }
```

`isDeployedOnL2()` is called with the [2nd parameter](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/moongate/src/InfernalRiftBelow.sol#L92-L93) hardcoded as `false`:

```solidity
    function isDeployedOnL2(address _l1CollectionAddress, bool _is1155) public view returns (bool isDeployed_) {
        isDeployed_ = l2AddressForL1Collection(_l1CollectionAddress, _is1155).code.length > 0;
    }
```

Which will check if the `InfernalRiftBelow` contract has deployed an ERC721 clone on the target L2, but using an ERC1155 address. This is impossible to happen in the protocol since whenever a token is bridged, the appropriate ERC type clone is deployed for the collection bridged. Hence, the `if (!isDeployedOnL2(_collectionAddress, false)) revert L1CollectionDoesNotExist()` check will always revert in `InfernalRiftBelow`.

Meanwhile, the `ERC1155Bridged` contract does have a [`claimRoyalties()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/moongate/src/libs/ERC1155Bridgable.sol#L116-L135) function, but due to the flawed hardcoded check, it just can't ever be reached.

## Impact
Royalty recipients of ERC1155 collections that want to claim royalties on the L2 counterpart will never be able to since the check will always fail and the whole function flow only takes into account ERC721 collection types in `isDeployedOnL2`. So loss of funds.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function claimRoyalties(address _collectionAddress, address _recipient, address[] calldata _tokens) public {
        // Ensure that our message is sent from the L1 domain messenger
        if (ICrossDomainMessenger(msg.sender).xDomainMessageSender() != INFERNAL_RIFT_ABOVE) {
            revert CrossChainSenderIsNotRiftAbove();
        }

        // Get our L2 address from the L1
@>      if (!isDeployedOnL2(_collectionAddress, false)) revert L1CollectionDoesNotExist();

        // Call our ERC721Bridgable contract as the owner to claim royalties to the recipient
        ERC721Bridgable(l2AddressForL1Collection(_collectionAddress, false)).claimRoyalties(_recipient, _tokens);
        emit RoyaltyClaimFinalized(_collectionAddress, _recipient, _tokens);
    }
```

Manual review

## Recommendation
Have 2 function flow branches, one for ERC721 and one for ERC1155
