# claimRoyalties will use wrong receiver

## Summary
In the `claimRoyalties` function incorrect receiver will be used.
## Vulnerability Detail
When calling `claimRoyalties` from `InfernalRiftAbove.sol` the code will actually get the receiver of the 0 token:
```solidity
// We can now pull the royalty information from the L1 to confirm that the caller
        // is the receiver of the royalties. We can't actually pull in the default royalty
        // provider so instead we just use token0.
        (address receiver,) = IERC2981(_collectionAddress).royaltyInfo(0, 0);
```
However when we check out the ERC2981 standard will can see that each token has its own `RoyaltyInfo` here:
https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/cb7faaf4db9d1ea443b507311487625220e5e215/contracts/token/common/ERC2981.sol#L29
So the following validation in `InfernalRiftAbove.sol` will revert because of the wrong receiver that is returned, or the receiver that has the 0th token will be able to claim the royalties for all other tokens that use the bridge:
```solidity
  // Check that the receiver of royalties is making this call
        if (receiver != msg.sender) revert CallerIsNotRoyaltiesReceiver(msg.sender, receiver);
```
## Impact
The receiver that is set for the 0th token will be able to claim the royalties for the full collection that uses the bridge and the other receivers for other token ids will not be able to use `claimRoyalties` - High.

## Recommendation
Do not claim the royalties for multiple tokens as each id has its own receiver. Do not use the 0th token but the actual id.
