# Missing implementation to claim ERC1155 royalties

## Summary
Missing implementation of claimRoyalties for ERC1155.
## Vulnerability Detail
When a user calls `claimRoyalties` from the `InfernalRiftAbove`, this will send a message to the `internalRiftBelow` which will use perform the following line:
```solidity
 ERC721Bridgable(l2AddressForL1Collection(_collectionAddress, false)).claimRoyalties(_recipient, _tokens);
```
However if the token is ERC1155 the `l2AddressForL1Collection` will return the wrong address because of the hardcoded `false` argument in the function. As a result because this address will never exist the whole function will always revert when trying to get ERC1155 royalties.
## Impact
DOS of royalty claiming for ERC1155
