# Moongate uses universal royalty for all the bridged tokens of an ERC721 contract

### Summary

The royalty for each token of an ERC721 contract can be different. The moongate bridge assumes that all of them are the same

### Root Cause

In [InfernalRiftAbove.sol:116](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/moongate/src/InfernalRiftAbove.sol#L116) it will use the royalty of the first token that's bridged of a given collection to determine the royalty for the whole collection.

However, according to [ERC-2981](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2981#specification), different royalty percentages for each token are allowed. It's also possible that the royalty fee changes over time.

Thus, using a static value for bridged tokens will cause the royalty to be less/more than expected.
