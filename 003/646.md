# Royalties paid on L2 for ERC1155 tokens cannot be claimed

## Summary
There is no functionality for claiming royalties paid on an ERC1155 token

## Vulnerability Detail
The `InfernalRiftBelow::claimRoyalties` function only allows ERC721 token royalties paid on the L2 to be claimed, and there is no other function performing claims for royalties paid to the L2 on ERC1155 tokens transfer.

## Impact
Royalties sent to the ERC1155 token on the L2 cannot be withdrawn or sent to the reciever/owner, hence they will be stuck.
