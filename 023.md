# Missing Check in claimAirdrop Will Cause a Reentrancy Attack for Token Holders

### Summary

The missing application of the nonReentrant modifier in the claimAirdrop function will cause a complete loss of funds for token holders as an attacker will exploit reentrancy to claim multiple times before the state is updated.

### Root Cause

In AirdropRecipient.sol:116, the missing nonReentrant modifier allows for reentrancy attacks in the claimAirdrop function during token or native asset transfers.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to distribute a merkle root via distributeAirdrop().
2. Airdrop needs to be initiated by a user calling claimAirdrop().
3. The isClaimed mapping for a particular merkle root and claim node must not be set to true.

### External pre-conditions

1. The attacker's wallet or contract must have some gas to perform the reentrancy attack.
2. There must be at least one valid ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155, or native token airdrop claim available.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker calls claimAirdrop() with valid MerkleProof.
2. During the transfer of tokens (ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155) or native tokens, the attacker calls into the contract again (reentrancy) before isClaimed[_merkle][_node] is set to true.
3. The attacker repeatedly calls claimAirdrop() through recursive calls, draining the tokens or Ether from the contract until the available funds are exhausted.

### Impact

The token holders suffer a complete loss of airdrop funds. The attacker gains control over multiple claims that should have only been claimed once.

// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later
pragma solidity >=0.8.0;

import "forge-std/Test.sol";
import "./AirdropRecipient.sol";

contract AttackContract {
    AirdropRecipient victim;
    bytes32 merkle;
    Enums.ClaimType claimType;
    MerkleClaim node;
    bytes32[] merkleProof;

    constructor(AirdropRecipient _victim) {
        victim = _victim;
    }

    fallback() external payable {
        // Re-entrancy attack
        victim.claimAirdrop(merkle, claimType, node, merkleProof);
    }

    function attack() public {
        // Initial claim that triggers the re-entrancy
        victim.claimAirdrop(merkle, claimType, node, merkleProof);
    }
}
```
`
### Mitigation

Apply the nonReentrant modifier to the claimAirdrop() function to prevent reentrancy. This will ensure that the claim is only processed once, regardless of any attempts to recursively call the function.


```solidity
function claimAirdrop(
    bytes32 _merkle, 
    Enums.ClaimType _claimType, 
    MerkleClaim calldata _node, 
    bytes32[] calldata _merkleProof
) public nonReentrant {
    // existing code
}
```
