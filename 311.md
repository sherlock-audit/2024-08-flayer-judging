# `InfernalRiftAbove.sol` locks ether without a withdrawal function, preventing access to funds

## Summary
The contract `InfernalRiftAbove` accepts Ether but lacks a corresponding withdrawal function to allow for the recovery of locked funds. This issue results in Ether being locked in the contract, inaccessible for withdrawal or utilization, which can cause operational and financial concerns.

## Vulnerability Detail
Contracts that accept Ether typically include a withdrawal function to allow the contract owner or authorized users to reclaim any Ether that has been sent to the contract. The absence of such a function can lead to:

**Locked Funds:** Ether sent to the contract cannot be recovered or used, potentially leading to loss of funds.

## Impact
**Inaccessibility of Funds:** Ether sent to the contract is locked and cannot be accessed or withdrawn, potentially resulting in financial loss.

## Recommendation
**Implement Withdrawal Function:** Add a public or external function to allow Ether to be withdrawn from the contract. This function should be secured with appropriate access control to prevent unauthorized withdrawals.
