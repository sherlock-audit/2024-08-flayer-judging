# Users can sandwich unlocking their protected listings to pay less fees

## Summary
The fee payment upon `unlockProtectedListing` invoke can be reduced by sandwiching it between a direct `deposit-redeem` in locker due to lack of cooldown period.
## Vulnerability Detail  

Whenever a user unlocks their protected listing they are obliged to pay accumulated interest fee on their `tokenTaken` which is calculated in `unlockPrice`  

```solidity
    function unlockPrice(address _collection, uint _tokenId) public view returns (uint unlockPrice_) {
        
        ProtectedListing memory listing = _protectedListings[_collection][_tokenId];

        unlockPrice_ = locker.taxCalculator().compound({
            _principle: listing.tokenTaken,
            _initialCheckpoint: collectionCheckpoints[_collection][listing.checkpoint],
            _currentCheckpoint: _currentCheckpoint(_collection)
        });
    }
```  
The method calculates interest by multiplying the principal amount (`tokenTaken`) by the result of currentCompoundFactor/initialCompoundFactor. However current compound factor uses live utilization rate which also uses live `collectionToken.totalSupply` to determine interest rates. The lower the utilization is - the lower the interest will be as well.  

```solidity
                utilizationRate_ = (listingsOfType_ * 1e36 * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination()) / totalSupply;
```
From the snippet above we can see that if `totalSupply` increases just before `unlockProtectedListing` is invoked, `unlockPrice` will return a smaller value due to the decreased utilization.  

Such attack is achievable since the user can sandwich the unlock mechanism by invoking functions in one transaction:  
1) [`Locker.deposit`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L144) to mint collection tokens at 1:1 ratio
2) `ProtectedListings.unlockProtectedListing` 
3) [`Locker.redeem`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L209) to burn the tokens from step 1 and retrieve their NFTs  

Since there are neither costs nor cooldowns imposed on `deposit-redeem` this attack is profitable.

## Recommendation
Impose a reasonable cooldown period (e.g 10 minutes - 1 day) on direct locker deposits. This way the attacker's NFTs are susceptible for anyone to redeem, making the exploit unprofitable.
