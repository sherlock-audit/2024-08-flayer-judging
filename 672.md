# Hardcoded starting spot price of `500 ether` for a 7 days dutch auction is too much

### Summary

_No response_

### Root Cause

When executing a collection shutdown via [CollectionShutdown::execute()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L231) the protocol creates a pool on sudoswap with the currently locked NFTs left in the protocol in an attempt of selling them.

The price at which the NFTs will be sold starts from `500 ether` and linearly decreases for 7 days, until it becomes `0`:
```solidity
    pairFactory.createPairERC721ETH({
        _nft: _collection,
        _bondingCurve: curve,
        _assetRecipient: payable(address(this)),
        _poolType: ILSSVMPair.PoolType.NFT,
@>   _delta: uint128(block.timestamp) << 96 | uint128(block.timestamp + 7 days) << 64,
        _fee: 0,
@>   _spotPrice: 500 ether,
        _propertyChecker: address(0),
        _initialNFTIDs: _tokenIds
    })
```

Using a constant price of `500 ether` for a 7 days dutch auction for every collection can be problematic. At the start of the last day the price will be `71.42 ether`, at the start of the last hour the price will be `2.97 ether`, at the start of the last minute the price will be `0.049 ether`. 

At the moment of writing `0.049 ether` is worth about `120$`, which means that for a collection whose NFT floor value is less than `120$` people have to try and buy the NFT at the right time during the last possible minute. If an NFT collection has a floor price of `20$` users only have 10 seconds to act.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

A linearly decreasing price is supposed to allow the market to buy NFTs at a price they deem fair but a too-high starting spot price doesn't allow this to happen. Using such a high spot price makes it extremely likely for the NFTs to be sold for free or much lower than they should, leading to a loss for current collection token holders.

### Mitigation

Since [CollectionShutdown::execute()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L231) is an admin-only callable function add an input parameter so the admins can choose a sensible spot price based on the collection being shutdown.
