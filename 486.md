# User Can Bypass Maximum Duration Limit for Liquid Listings via Modification

## Summary
Users can bypass the maximum duration limit for liquid listings by modifying the listing just before it reaches the  `MAX_LIQUID_DURATION`, effectively extending it indefinitely.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `modifyListings` function allows users to extend the duration of a `liquidlisting` without accounting for the total *time elapsed* since the listing's original start date. This oversight enables users to repeatedly extend the listing duration, circumventing the MAX_LIQUID_DURATION constraint.

### Initial Liquid Listing:
A user creates a **liquid listing** with a duration set to just under the **maximum allowed limit (MAX_LIQUID_DURATION)**, starting on **Day 1**.

### Modification Before Expiry:
Just before the listing reaches its maximum duration, the user uses the `modifyListings` function to extend the duration, effectively bypassing the maximum limit.

### Bypassing the Limit:
If the `modifyListings` function does not account for the total time since the listing's original start date, the user can repeatedly extend the duration, circumventing the intended **maximum duration constraint**.
## Impact
This vulnerability allows users to maintain liquid listings beyond the intended maximum duration, potentially leading to market manipulation and undermining the protocol's economic model.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a mechanism to track the original start time of each listing. Modify the modifyListings function to calculate the total duration from the original start time and enforce the `MAX_LIQUID_DURATION` constraint based on this total duration.
```diff
- if (params.duration > MAX_LIQUID_DURATION) 
-     revert ListingDurationExceedsMax(params.duration, MAX_LIQUID_DURATION);
+ if (params.duration + (block.timestamp - start_time) > MAX_LIQUID_DURATION) 
+     revert ListingDurationExceedsMax(params.duration, MAX_LIQUID_DURATION);
```
