# Owner should be allowed to set signer only once, else some of the  signed signatures/transactions will fail

### Summary

In the `AirdropRecipient.sol`, the owner is able to set the `erc1272Signer` by calling `setERC1271Signer(...)`. Once the signer is set, the users will submit transaction to verify  if the signature is valid. Since the signing happens offline, the submission of transaction is at the discretion of the user.

If the owner updates the  `erc1272Signer` with a new value, the transaction with signatures generated and pending submission will revert.



### Root Cause

In the below function, the owner is able to set the `erc1272Signer` multiple time, which could lead of grievances for the users. The signed transaction will revert due to failure to match.

This will happens because the signature is generated using the old `erc1272Signer` while the verification is being done against the new  `erc1272Signer`  which will not match

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Generate signature for a transaction
2. As owner, update the `erc1272Signer` by calling `setERC1271Signer()` with a different address
3. the transaction should revert 

### Impact

The transactions signed by the users will revert if the  `erc1272Signer`  is updated.

### PoC

### Mitigation

The recommendation is to restrict updating of  `erc1272Signer` for the first time only.
Once the value is set, a new value cannot be assigned to ` `erc1272Signer` .

To achieve this, implement the logic as below.

```solidity
  function setERC1271Signer(address _signer) external onlyOwner {
  +    require(erc1272Signer==address(0x0),"Signer already set");
  +    require(_signer !=address(0x0),"Signer cannot be zero address");  
        erc1272Signer = _signer;
    }
```
