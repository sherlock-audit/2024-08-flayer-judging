# Attacker re-enters the setTokenURIAndMintFromRiftAbove() function

### Summary

Due to the lack of Reentrancy Guard `nonReentrant` in the `ERC1155Bridgable.sol` contract, an attacker can mint a large amount of tokens using reentrancy.

### Root Cause

In `ERC1155Bridgable:101` due to the lack of Reentrancy Guard `nonReentrant`


The root cause of this problem:

OpenZeppelin's ERC1155.sol includes callback functions to manage NFTs and prevent them from getting stuck in contracts. For NFT contracts, there exist some implicit external function calls that could be neglected by developers. They include `onERC1155Received` function. The `onERC1155Received` function was designed to check whether the receiver contract can handle NFTs. This function is invoked in the `_mint()` of the `ERC1155Bridgable` contract. Due to this external function call, the reentrancy could happen without being noticed by contract developer.

The `_mint()` function is called in the `setTokenURIAndMintFromRiftAbove()` function.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/moongate/src/libs/ERC1155Bridgable.sol#L101
```solidity
    function setTokenURIAndMintFromRiftAbove(uint _id, uint _amount, string memory _uri, address _recipient) external {
        if (msg.sender != INFERNAL_RIFT_BELOW) {
            revert NotRiftBelow();
        }

        // Set our tokenURI
        uriForToken[_id] = _uri;

        // Mint the token to the specified recipient
        _mint(_recipient, _id, _amount, '');
    }
```

And there we can see that mint will ultimately try to call a function onERC1155Received on the receiving function. Now we have handed control over to another contract.

According to what I said above, the malicious person can abuse the same things and write in the `onERC1155Received` function of his contract to call the `setTokenURIAndMintFromRiftAbove()` function many times in a loop. The same thing can happen with the setTokenURIAndMintFromRiftAbove function.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls the `setTokenURIAndMintFromRiftAbove()` function.

2. Due to the lack of Reentrancy Guard adherence, the attacker re-enters the `setTokenURIAndMintFromRiftAbove()` function in `onERC1155Received` before the initial call completes.

3. This process can be repeated, allowing the attacker to mint tokens more than their allowed.

### Impact

Regarding the mint function, the malicious person can mint a large amount of tokens using reentrancy.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a reentrancy guard (`nonReentrant()`)
