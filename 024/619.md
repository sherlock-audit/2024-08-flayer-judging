# The createListings function may cause a DoS attack due to the lack of array length limit

## Summary
The `createListings` function may cause a DoS attack due to the lack of an array length limit, allowing attackers to exhaust the gas by passing an excessively large array.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `createListings` function, an external caller can pass an unbounded array of `CreateListing[]` as input. Since there is no limit on the array length, a malicious actor could craft a transaction with a very large array, leading to an excessive gas consumption and eventually causing the transaction to fail. This could result in a DoS for legitimate users by preventing them from successfully creating listings.

## Impact
If exploited, the contract could be rendered unusable for creating listings. Attackers can effectively block the contract by passing large input arrays that would lead to transaction failures due to out-of-gas errors. This creates a denial of service for legitimate users, disrupting the functionality of the contract.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L130-L137
```solidity
    function createListings(CreateListing[] calldata _createListings) public nonReentrant lockerNotPaused {
        // Loop variables
        uint taxRequired;
        uint tokensIdsLength;
        uint tokensReceived;

        // Loop over the unique listing structures
        for (uint i; i < _createListings.length; ++i) {
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Set a maximum limit for the array length to ensure gas consumption remains manageable. Example:
```solidity
uint constant MAX_LISTINGS = ?; 
function createListings(CreateListing[] calldata _createListings) public nonReentrant lockerNotPaused {
    require(_createListings.length <= MAX_LISTINGS, "Too many listings");

    // Loop variables
    uint taxRequired;
    uint tokensIdsLength;
    uint tokensReceived;

    // Loop over the unique listing structures
    for (uint i; i < _createListings.length; ++i) {
    }
```
