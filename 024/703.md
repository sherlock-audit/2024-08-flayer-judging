# Denial of Service (DoS) Vulnerability in `createListings` Function Due to Unbounded Loop

## Summary
The `createListings` function in the Listings contract processes an array of `CreateListing` structs. If the array is excessively large, the function can consume excessive gas, potentially leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) by preventing the transaction from completing successfully.
## Vulnerability Detail
The` createListings` function iterates over the `_createListings` array to process each listing. Since Solidity imposes a `block gas limit`, a large array can cause the transaction to exceed this limit, resulting in a failed transaction. This can be exploited to prevent the contract from processing legitimate listings, effectively causing a DoS.
## Impact
Denial of Service: Legitimate users may be unable to create listings if an attacker submits a transaction with an excessively large array, consuming all available gas.
Potential Financial Loss: Users may incur transaction fees for failed transactions due to excessive gas consumption.

## Recommendation
Batch Processing: Encourage users to submit listings in smaller batches. This can be achieved by setting a reasonable limit on the array size and providing guidance in the contract's documentation.
