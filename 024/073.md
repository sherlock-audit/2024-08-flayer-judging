# Excessive Gas Consumption in `createListings` Function Leading to Denial of Service

## Summary
The `createListings` function in the `ProtectedListings` contract is susceptible to excessive gas consumption when processing a large number of listings in a single transaction. This vulnerability can lead to transaction failures due to exceeding the block gas limit, resulting in a denial of service for users attempting to create multiple listings simultaneously.

## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the unbounded loop within the `createListings` function, which processes each listing in the `_createListings` array. Each iteration involves multiple gas-intensive operations, including validation, mapping, NFT transfers, and event emissions. The absence of a limit on the number of listings processed in a single transaction exacerbates the issue.

155:         }

156:     }
```

## Impact
- Users will not be able to create listings if their transaction fails due to exceeding the gas limit.
- Users who attempt to create multiple listings in a single transaction may be subject to significant gas fees for transactions that ultimately fail.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a limit on the number of listings that can be processed in a single transaction. This can be achieved by introducing a maximum batch size and enforcing it within the `createListings` function.
```diff
+ uint constant MAX_LISTINGS_PER_TRANSACTION = 10; // Set reasonable limits

function createListings(CreateListing[] calldata _createListings) public nonReentrant lockerNotPaused {

+   require(_createListings.length <= MAX_LISTINGS_PER_TRANSACTION, "Too many listings in a single transaction");

    uint checkpointIndex;

    bytes32 checkpointKey;

    uint tokensIdsLength;

    uint tokensReceived;

    for (uint i; i < _createListings.length; ++i) {

        CreateListing calldata listing = _createListings[i];

        _validateCreateListing(listing);

        checkpointKey = keccak256(abi.encodePacked('checkpointIndex', listing.collection));

        assembly { checkpointIndex := tload(checkpointKey) }

        if (checkpointIndex == 0) {

            checkpointIndex = _createCheckpoint(listing.collection);

            assembly { tstore(checkpointKey, checkpointIndex) }

        }

        tokensIdsLength = listing.tokenIds.length;

        tokensReceived = _mapListings(listing, tokensIdsLength, checkpointIndex) * 10 ** locker.collectionToken(listing.collection).denomination();

        unchecked {

            listingCount[listing.collection] += tokensIdsLength;

        }

        _depositNftsAndReceiveTokens(listing, tokensReceived);

        emit ListingsCreated(listing.collection, listing.tokenIds, listing.listing, tokensReceived, msg.sender);

    }

}
```
