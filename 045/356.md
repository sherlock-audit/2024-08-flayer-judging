# Lack of Ownership Verification in deposit() of Locker contract

## Summary
The deposit() function does not check whether the msg.sender owns the NFTs being deposited. This can allow users to deposit NFTs they don't own, leading to unauthorized token minting.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function allows users to deposit NFTs without verifying whether the user owns those NFTs. As a result, attackers can deposit NFTs they donâ€™t own and mint ERC20 tokens fraudulently. This is especially dangerous in cases where ERC20 tokens can be redeemed for valuable assets.

## Impact
Attackers could mint ERC20 tokens from NFTs they do not own, resulting in a loss of trust in the contract and an inflation of the token supply.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add an ownership check using IERC721.ownerOf to verify that the msg.sender owns the NFTs they are depositing
```solidity
for (uint i = 0; i < tokenIdsLength; ++i) {
    require(collection.ownerOf(_tokenIds[i]) == msg.sender, "Caller does not own the NFT");
    collection.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _tokenIds[i]);
}
```
