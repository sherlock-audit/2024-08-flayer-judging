# Lack of Ownership Verification and Potential Asset Loss in swap() and swapBatch() of Locker contract

## Summary
While the function correctly checks that the tokens are not the same and ensures the outgoing token is not listed, it lacks ownership verification for the token being swapped and could lead to loss of assets or potential exploitation.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function does not verify whether the msg.sender owns the NFT they are attempting to swap (_tokenIdIn). This could allow malicious users to swap NFTs they don't own, causing issues in the contractâ€™s ownership records and potentially leading to asset loss.
Additionally, the function directly transfers the NFT back to the user without additional checks on the value of the NFT being swapped or the security of the exchange process.

## Impact
Malicious users could attempt to swap NFTs they do not own, causing discrepancies in the contract and potential asset loss for other users.
Without any checks on the value of the NFTs being swapped, a user could exploit the contract by exchanging low-value NFTs for high-value ones.
Improper ownership verification or unexpected behavior during transfers could lead to permanent loss of NFTs.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure that the user attempting to swap the NFT actually owns _tokenIdIn by adding a check using IERC721.ownerOf()
`require(IERC721(_collection).ownerOf(_tokenIdIn) == msg.sender, "Caller is not the owner of the token");`
