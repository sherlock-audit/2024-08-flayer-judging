# User can receive 0 tokens from creating a Listing.

### Summary

The vulnerability exists because of a flaw in `Listings.sol:150` , which has a check that reverts if `taxRequired`  is greater than `tokensReceived`.   The `tokensReceived` value to be sent to user after listing has to have `taxRequired ` subtracted from it. Which means taxRequired always has to be less than `tokensReceived` before this deduction is done. However , the check doesn't accomodate  a scenario where they are both the same value and the subsequent subtraction will lead to `tokensReceived` resulting in 0.


### Root Cause

`createListing` in  [`Listings.sol:150`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L150)  uses the `>` operand while checking `taxRequired` and  ` tokensReceived`.
 ```solidity
      if (taxRequired > tokensReceived) revert InsufficientTax(tokensReceived, taxRequired);
 ``` 
This means there can exist a scenario where `taxRequired` and `tokensReceived` are the same value. Hence, when the deduction of `taxRequired` from `tokensReceived` is done, user is left with 0 tokens.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

User doesn't get any tokens from creating a Listing.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

In `Listings:150` change the code to : 
 ```diff
+ if (taxRequired >= tokensReceived) revert InsufficientTax(tokensReceived, taxRequired);
```

This now ensures the call reverts if `taxRequired` is greater than `tokensReceived` or they are the same value. And also that the listing can only proceed if there are enough tokens left (for the user) after tax has been deducted.
