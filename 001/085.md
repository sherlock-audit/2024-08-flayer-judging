# Double Voting Exploit in Collection Shutdown Process

## Summary
The `_vote` function in the `CollectionShutdown` contract allows users to vote multiple times by transferring tokens between accounts. This lack of restriction can lead to manipulation of the voting process, undermining the integrity of the shutdown mechanism.

## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause is that the `_vote` function does not implement a check to ensure that users can only vote once per token they own. This allows users to transfer tokens to another account and vote again, effectively casting multiple votes with the same token.
```solidity
191:     function _vote(address _collection, CollectionShutdownParams memory params) internal returns (CollectionShutdownParams memory) {
---
193:         uint userVotes = params.collectionToken.balanceOf(msg.sender);
194:         if (userVotes == 0) revert UserHoldsNoTokens();
195: 
---
197:         params.collectionToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), userVotes);
198: 
---
200:         params.shutdownVotes += uint96(userVotes);
201: 
---
203:         unchecked { shutdownVoters[_collection][msg.sender] += userVotes; }
204: 
---
205:         emit CollectionShutdownVote(_collection, msg.sender, userVotes);
206: 
---
208:         if (!params.canExecute && params.shutdownVotes >= params.quorumVotes) {
209:             params.canExecute = true;
210:             emit CollectionShutdownQuorumReached(_collection);
211:         }
212: 
---
213:         return params;
214:     }
```
The code does not check if the user has already voted with those tokens. This allows users to transfer tokens to another account and vote again, effectively casting multiple votes with the same tokens.

## Impact
Users can unfairly influence the outcome of the shutdown vote by casting multiple votes with the same tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a mechanism to ensure that each token can only be used to vote once.
- Introduce a mapping to track tokens that have already been used for voting.
```diff
// Mapping to track used tokens for voting
mapping(address => mapping(uint => bool)) private usedTokens;
```
- Before allowing a vote, check if the tokens have already been used. If not, mark them as used.
```diff
function _vote(address _collection, CollectionShutdownParams memory params) internal returns (CollectionShutdownParams memory) {
    uint userVotes = params.collectionToken.balanceOf(msg.sender);
    if (userVotes == 0) revert UserHoldsNoTokens();

    // Check if tokens have already been used for voting
+   for (uint i = 0; i < userVotes; i++) {
+       uint tokenId = params.collectionToken.tokenOfOwnerByIndex(msg.sender, i);
+       if (usedTokens[_collection][tokenId]) {
+           revert TokenAlreadyUsedForVoting();
        }
    }

-   params.collectionToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), userVotes);

    // Pull tokens in from the user and mark them as used
+   for (uint i = 0; i < userVotes; i++) {
+       uint tokenId = params.collectionToken.tokenOfOwnerByIndex(msg.sender, i);
+       params.collectionToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), tokenId);
+       usedTokens[_collection][tokenId] = true;
    }

    params.shutdownVotes += uint96(userVotes);
    unchecked { shutdownVoters[_collection][msg.sender] += userVotes; }

    emit CollectionShutdownVote(_collection, msg.sender, userVotes);

    if (!params.canExecute && params.shutdownVotes >= params.quorumVotes) {
        params.canExecute = true;
        emit CollectionShutdownQuorumReached(_collection);
    }

    return params;
}
```
