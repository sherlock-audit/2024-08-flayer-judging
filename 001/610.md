# FTokens are burned after `quorumVotes` are recorded making a portion of the shares unclaimable

### Summary

`params.quorumVotes` is larger than it should because Locker's collection tokens are [burned](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L245-L251) after `quorumVotes` is recorded.

```solidity
    uint newQuorum = params.collectionToken.totalSupply() * SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT / ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT;
    if (params.quorumVotes != newQuorum) {
        params.quorumVotes = uint88(newQuorum);
    }

    // Lockdown the collection to prevent any new interaction
    // @audit sunsetCollection() burns the Locker's tokens decreasing the `totalSupply`. If this was called before
    // `params.quorumVotes` was set, the totalSupply() would be smaller and each vote would get more share of the ETH profits.
    locker.sunsetCollection(_collection);
```

When a collection is shut down, its NFTs are sold off via Dutch auction in a SudoSwap pool. This sale's ETH profits are distributed to the holders of the collection token (fToken).

The [claim amount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L310) is calculated with `availableClaim * claimableVotes / params.quorumVotes * 2`.  The higher `params.quorumVotes`, the lower the claim amount for each vote. 

### Root Cause

`params.quorumVotes` is larger than it should because Locker's collection tokens are [burned](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L245-L251) after `quorumVotes` is recorded.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. At least 50% of Holders have [voted](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L208-L209) for a collection to shut down. 
2. No [listings](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L241) for the target collection exist. 

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Admin calls [`CollectionShutdown::execute()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L231). The vulnerability always happens when this is called.

### Impact

A portion of the claimable ETH can never be claimed and all voters can claim less ETH.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider calling `Locker::sunsetCollection()` before setting the `params.quorumVotes` in [`CollectionShutdown::execute()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L245-L251).
