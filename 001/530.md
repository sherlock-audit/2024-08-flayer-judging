# Creation of listings does not accurately reflect the utilization rate, which could lead to loss of interest

## Summary
The `createListings()` function in both `Listings.sol` and `ProtectedListing.sol` has a flaw that prevents accurate checkpoint creation.

## Vulnerability Detail
The main vulnerability is in `ProtectedListing.sol`, where we can call `createListings()` and specify an array of `CreateListing` that we want to create:

```solidity
  function createListings(CreateListing[] calldata _createListings) public nonReentrant lockerNotPaused {
```

The issue lies in the logic that ensures `_createCheckpoint` is only called once per collection. While this is intended, the problem occurs because this action happens **before** all the changes that may affect the **utilization rate**.

```solidity
  function createListings(CreateListing[] calldata _createListings) public nonReentrant lockerNotPaused {
  ....Skip Code....
        for (uint i; i < _createListings.length; ++i) {
            CreateListing calldata listing = _createListings[i];
            _validateCreateListing(listing);

@>>         checkpointKey = keccak256(abi.encodePacked('checkpointIndex', listing.collection));
            assembly { checkpointIndex := tload(checkpointKey) }
@>>      if (checkpointIndex == 0) {
@>>             checkpointIndex = _createCheckpoint(listing.collection);
                assembly { tstore(checkpointKey, checkpointIndex) }
            }

            tokensIdsLength = listing.tokenIds.length;
            tokensReceived = _mapListings(listing, tokensIdsLength, checkpointIndex) * 10 ** 
locker.collectionToken(listing.collection).denomination();

            unchecked {
@>>             listingCount[listing.collection] += tokensIdsLength;
            }

@>>         _depositNftsAndReceiveTokens(listing, tokensReceived);
        }
```            

The `_createCheckpoint` **_must be called after the listing is added to the `listingCount[]` and after the changes to the total supply of CT_**, which in this case occurs when `_depositNftsAndReceiveTokens` is called. This function mints new `CT`, impacting the total supply. The total supply directly affects the **utilization rate**, which is used to calculate the compound interest rate.

However, in the current logic, `_createCheckpoint` is called **before** changes that affect the **utilization rate**, the `listingCount[]`, and the `totalSupply`:

```solidity
    function utilizationRate(address _collection)  {
@>>     listingsOfType_ = listingCount[_collection];
        if (listingsOfType_ != 0) {
            ICollectionToken collectionToken = locker.collectionToken(_collection);
            uint totalSupply = collectionToken.totalSupply();
            if (totalSupply != 0) {
@>>             utilizationRate_ = (listingsOfType_ * 1e36 * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination()) / totalSupply;
            }
        }
    }
```

## Impact
This behavior contradicts the required functionality as stated in the comments in both [Listings.cancelListings()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L466-L467) and [Listings.fillListings()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L602-L603):

```solidity
@>> // Create our checkpoint as utilization rates will change
@>> protectedListings.createCheckpoint(listing.collection);
```
And in [ProtectedListings.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L480-L481)
```solidity
@>>  // Update our checkpoint to reflect that listings have been removed
 @>> _createCheckpoint(_collection);
 ```
 
**Root Causes:**
- **`createCheckpoint` is only called for the first created listing** of a specific collection, not the last one. This means the calculation of the new **checkpoint compoundingFactor** is incorrect, as **utilization rate changes** occur after the checkpoint is created. The increase in **listing count** is not reflected in the checkpoint.
- **`createCheckpoint` is executed before the minting of `CT`**, which means the total supply and utilization rate are not correctly updated at the time of checkpoint creation.

As a result, this can also lead to **lower interest rates**, which may accrue over time, reducing the overall accuracy of the protocol's interest calculation.

## Tool Used
**Manual Review**

## Recommendation
Since a user may list multiple collections via `ProtectedListing.sol` or `Listings.sol` through `createListings()`, but for different collections, the best approach is to maintain an array `address[] collections;` to track the **unique collections**. After the loops are executed, perform another loop to call `_createCheckpoint(listing.collection)` for each unique collection.
