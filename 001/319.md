# Missing update `availableClaim` when users claim voting rewards

## Summary
Voters may claim more rewards if the collection is not in the first shut down flow.

## Vulnerability Detail
When one collection market is shut down, we can recreate this collection market via `createCollection()` if the collection market becomes active again. It's possible that we will trigger the same collection's shutdown flow several times.
In the first shut down flow, we accure the `availableClaim`. The problem is that when voters claim their rewards, we don't update the `availableClaim`.
When we start to shutdown this collection market for the second time, this collection market's rewards will be based on the first shutdown `availableClaim`. Voters may get more rewards than expected if there is enough balance in the contract, or some voters may not get rewards.

```solidity
    receive() external payable {
        address sweeperCollection = sweeperPoolCollection[msg.sender];
        if (sweeperCollection != address(0)) {
@>            _collectionParams[sweeperCollection].availableClaim += msg.value;
            emit CollectionShutdownTokenLiquidated(sweeperCollection, msg.value);
        }
    }
```

## Impact
Voters may get more rewards than expected if there is enough balance in the contract, or some voters may not get rewards.

## Recommendation
When voters claim their rewards, `availableClaim` should be timely updated.
