# manipulation of the Utilization Rates using the locker.sol function deposit and redeem to Force Liquidations

## Summary
A user with a significant number of *NFTs* can manipulate the `totalsupply` of *ERC20* tokens to indirectly push protected listings towards liquidation by influencing the `utilizationrate` and associated .
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises from the ability of a user to `deposit` and `redeem` any quantities of NFTs,without fees As shown in the `locker.sol` contract :
-the `deposit` function increase the *totalsupply* by `mint` function.

``` js
function deposit(address _collection, uint[] calldata _tokenIds, address _recipient) public
    {
     //.....
        ICollectionToken token = _collectionToken[_collection];
        token.mint(_recipient, tokenIdsLength * 1 ether * 10 ** token.denomination());
    //.....
     }
 ```
-and decrease the *totalsupply* using the `redeem` function. 

```js 

 function redeem(address _collection, uint[] calldata _tokenIds, address _recipient)  public 
   { 
     //...
 collectionToken_.burnFrom(msg.sender, tokenIdsLength * 1 ether * 10 ** collectionToken_.denomination());
    //..
  }

```
so a user with a lot of nft could thereby alter the total supply of ERC20 tokens ,This manipulation affects the utilization rate,

which in turn influences interest rates that used directly to calculate `calculateCompoundedFactor`

```js 

 function calculateCompoundedFactor(uint _previousCompoundedFactor, uint _utilizationRate, uint _timePeriod) public view returns (uint compoundedFactor_) {
        uint interestRate = this.calculateProtectedInterest(_utilizationRate);
        uint perSecondRate = (interestRate * 1e18) / (365 * 24 * 60 * 60);
        compoundedFactor_ = _previousCompoundedFactor * 
        (1e18 + (perSecondRate / 1000 * _timePeriod)) / 1e18;
    }

```

we use this to Calculate the amount of tax that would need to be paid against protected listings. in the function `unlockPrice`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L607-L617
 this function is used to check the the protected listing health in `getProtectedListingHealth` that used in `liquidateProtectedListing` An exploitation of the direct relation between the totalsupply and the liquidation is possible by a malicious user who owns half of the **NFTs**. The user can performs an action that causes the liquidation of the positions of the other participants and receives the `KEEPER_REWARD` for being a keeper for initiating the liquidation process. In addition, the user can buy up the one that had its **NFT** liquidated at an auction at a discount price which increases their gain. 

## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is that it allows a user to exploit the system to force protected listings into liquidation. This can lead to losses for other users whose listings are liquidated. It undermines the stability and fairness of the protocol by enabling manipulative tactics.
