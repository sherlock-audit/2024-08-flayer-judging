# Tax is resolved on liquidation listings when they are relisted

### Summary

A liquidation listing is treated as a normal batch auction listing – can be filled or relisted. Filling a liquidation listing, however, does **not** refund tax to the owner of the listing. On the other hand, relisting a liquidation listing doesn't take this into account and would happily send fee to the **UniswapImplementation** contract and refund tax to the owner of the listing in a situation where the owner never has actually paid tax on the protected listing, breaking a main protocol invariant.


### Root Cause

There is no check in the **Listings**#`relist()` function if the listing being relisted is a liquidation one or not which makes the relisting functionality process the tax for the listing. Liquidation listings are created only for protected listings once their collateral goes underwater. A main protocol invariant, however, is that tax is not paid on protected listings as the code shows and the sponsor also confirmed that.

### Internal pre-conditions

Have a protected listing that's liquidated and thus a liquidation batch auction listing is created for it.


### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Not needed.

### Impact

Whenever a user borrows against an NFT by creating a protected listing and that listing gets liquidated, that same user will get refunded tax they've never paid in the first place when that NFT gets relisted. The user will effectively extract value out of thin air in the form of CollectionTokens which they can later convert to WETH or use to obtain another NFT.

This will also result in more fees being sent to the **UniswapImplementation** contract or if there aren't enough CollectionTokens for that collection available in the **Listings** contract it'll make relisting the NFT revert.


### PoC

1. John has an NFT from a collection and creates a protected listing for it, borrowing up to 0.95e18 CollectionTokens.
2. As time goes on the loan accrues interest and goes underwater.
3. A liquidator comes in and liquidates the listing by calling **ProtectedListings**#`liquidateProtectedListing()`.
4. Now a batch auction listing with a `duration` of 4 days and a `floorMultiple` of `400` is created in the **Listings** contract and John is set as the `owner` of the liquidation listing.
5. Dillon sees the listing and decides to relist it for a higher price, so he calls **Listings**#`relist()`.
6. The function proceeds to resolve the listing tax and refunds the appropriate amount of tax to the owner of the listing – John and also sends fee to the **UniswapImplementation** contract.
7. John has never paid tax on the protected listing but now tax is being resolved for that same listing.


### Mitigation

Just as in `_fillListing()` and `reserve()`, check if the listing is a liquidation one and if it is do **not** resolve its tax.
