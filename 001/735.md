# Incorrect tax accounting due to failure in handling liquidation listings in `Listings::relist()`

## Summary

The [`Listings::relist()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L625-L672) function fails to correctly manage liquidation listings, which do not pay taxes and should not be included in tax calculations. However, the current implementation calculates refunds based on the floor, leading to improper tax usage and incorrect accounting.

## Vulnerability Detail

Liquidation listings, created through the [`Listings::createLiquidationListing()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L178-L208) function, are not taxed like normal listings. Regular listings prepay taxes that are used to spend as fees for the [`UniswapImplementation`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L948). If the listing period ends early, users are refunded the unused portion of prepaid taxes. 

However, liquidation listings should be exempt from tax calculations and refunds, but the [`Listings::relist()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L625-L672) function does not properly differentiate between liquidation and regular listings.

This issue arises because the refund is calculated using the floor value, even for liquidation listings that are not subject to taxes. As a result, liquidation listings mistakenly receive tax refunds, which leads to incorrect accounting and fee distribution.

## Impact

Incorrect tax is being accounted to liquidation listings, and funds meant for non-liquidation listings are being used improperly. This leads to eligible listings losing part of their prepaid taxes during the relisting process of liquidation listings.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Two possible approaches can be taken depending on the desired design:

### 1. Allow relisting of liquidation listings:

In this approach, ensure that liquidation listings are relisted but do not participate in tax refund calculations or fee distributions since they are exempt from taxes.

```diff
File: Listings.sol

function relist(CreateListing calldata _listing, bool _payTaxWithEscrow) public nonReentrant lockerNotPaused {
---

-    // We can process a tax refund for the existing listing
+    // We can process a tax refund for the existing listing if it isn't a liquidation
+   if (!_isLiquidation[_collection][_tokenId]) {
        (uint _fees,) = _resolveListingTax(oldListing, _collection, true);
        if (_fees != 0) {
            emit ListingFeeCaptured(_collection, _tokenId, _fees);
        }
+   }

---
}
```

### 2. Do not allow relisting of liquidation listings:

In this approach, prevent liquidation listings from being relisted by reverting the transaction when an attempt to relist is made.

```diff
function relist(uint _listingId, uint _newDuration) external returns (uint listingId) {
---

+   // Revert if attempting to relist a liquidation listing
+   if (_isLiquidation[_collection][_tokenId]) {
+       revert NotAllowLiquidationListing;
+   }

---
}
```
