# Incorrect Checkpoint Index Handling When Timestamps Match Between Updates

### Summary

[ProtectedListings::_createCheckpoint](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L530-L571) function returns an incorrect checkpoint index when timestamps are identical between the last update and the current timestamp.

### Root Cause

When [ProtectedListings::_createCheckpoint](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L530-L571) function is invoked during a call, it stores the index of the to-be-created checkpoint as the length of the stored collection checkpoints. This makes sense, since if I have an array of uints: [0, 1, 2, 3] and I plan to push 4 into the array, the index of the previous array length will point to the newly pushed-in value. [0,1,2,3,4].
But what if nothing is pushed into the array?
That's the problem with [_createCheckpoint](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L530-L571) function, when the time between the last update and current timestamp is the same, only the compounded factor is updated, but the index meant to point to the new checkpoint is never changed.
```solidity
      if (checkpoint.timestamp == collectionCheckpoints[_collection][index_ - 1].timestamp) {
            collectionCheckpoints[_collection][index_ - 1].compoundedFactor = checkpoint.compoundedFactor;
            return index_;
        }
```
For our used example, index 4 will be returned, which currently points to no value in the array, since the array is still as it is [0,1,2,3], and thus out of bound.

An attacker can take advantage of this, by first triggering the collection checkpoint update and then call [ProtectedListings::createListings](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L117-L156) function to create a listing with a checkpoint index pointed to a not yet computed checkpoint, thus cutting down on the interest he is meant to pay for the position.
This is possible since in createListings, the returned index from [_createCheckpoint](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L530-L571) is used to update the users checkpoint index in [_mapListings](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L198-L210) function:
```solidity
    function _mapListings(
        CreateListing memory _createListing,
        uint _tokenIds,
        uint _checkpointIndex
    ) internal returns (uint tokensReceived_) {
        // Loop through our tokens
        for (uint i; i < _tokenIds; ++i) {
            // Update our request with the current checkpoint and store the listing
            _createListing.listing.checkpoint = _checkpointIndex;
            _protectedListings[_createListing.collection][
                _createListing.tokenIds[i]
            ] = _createListing.listing;

              }

                  ..............
    }
```


### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Using a smart contract, the attacker can either first create a listing for this collection in the Listings contract, or cancel an existing listing he has in the Listings contract for this collection.
Both of these actions will trigger a checkpoint update for the collection in ProtectedListings contract.
```solidity
       protectedListings.createCheckpoint(_collection);
``` 
Then call [ProtectedListings::createListings](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L117-L156) function to create a listing for the collection with a checkpoint index pointed to a not yet created collection checkpoint.

### Mitigation

Update to:
```solidity
        if (checkpoint.timestamp == collectionCheckpoints[_collection][index_ - 1].timestamp) {
            collectionCheckpoints[_collection][index_ - 1].compoundedFactor = checkpoint.compoundedFactor;
            return index_ - 1;
        }
```
