# Funds will be stuck in the `CollectionShutdown` contract if shutdown execution is cancelled

### Summary

When `CollectionShutdown::cancel(...)` is called to cancel the shutdown of a collection, users who have previously voted for the collection to be shutdown will loose their tokens and all functions related to collection in the `CollectionShutdown` contract will be rendered useless

### Root Cause

When users call vote their total collection token is transferred to the `CollectionShutdown` contract as shown below

```solidity
File: CollectionShutdown.sol
191:     function _vote(address _collection, CollectionShutdownParams memory params) internal returns (CollectionShutdownParams memory) {
192:         // Take tokens from the user and hold them in this escrow contract
193:         uint userVotes = params.collectionToken.balanceOf(msg.sender);
194:         if (userVotes == 0) revert UserHoldsNoTokens();
195: 
196:         // Pull our tokens in from the user
197:   @>    params.collectionToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), userVotes);

SNIP       ...........
214:     }

```


The problem is that when [`cancel(...)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L403) is called, as shown on L403 the entire `CollectionShutdownParams` of the collection is deleted thus rendering all interactions with the token useless in the `CollectionShutdown` contract. 

```solidity
File: CollectionShutdown.sol
390:     function cancel(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {

SNIP      .........

402:         // Remove our execution flag
403:   @>    delete _collectionParams[_collection];
404:         emit CollectionShutdownCancelled(_collection);
405:     }

```


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- a shutdown flow has not been triggered and the total supply of the token has risen above the threshold
- `cancel(...)` is called
- `CollectionShutdownParams` is wiped out of storage for the collection rendering all interactions with the `CollectionShutdown` contract useless
- users funds are stuck in the contract

### Impact

- User vote tokens are stuck in the contract
- The collection is rendered useless in the contract because all its shutdown parameters are rendered useless

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the `cancel(...)` function to delete only the execution flag for the collection as shown below

```diff
    function cancel(address _collection) public whenNotPaused { // @audit 11) if a collection grows before shutdown is triggered, canceling the shutdown process will cause the existing token votes to be stuck in the CSD contract because they can neither claim sudo's liq proceeds or reclaim() their votes because the params have been wiped and most of its feilds read zero or default value
        // Ensure that the vote count has reached quorum @audit replace 403 with delete _collectionParams[_collection].canExecute
        CollectionShutdownParams memory params = _collectionParams[_collection];
        if (!params.canExecute) revert ShutdownNotReachedQuorum();

        // Check if the total supply has surpassed an amount of the initial required
        // total supply. This would indicate that a collection has grown since the
        // initial shutdown was triggered and could result in an unsuspected liquidation.
        if (params.collectionToken.totalSupply() <= MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS * 10 ** locker.collectionToken(_collection).denomination()) {
            revert InsufficientTotalSupplyToCancel();
        }

        // Remove our execution flag
-       delete _collectionParams[_collection];
+       delete _collectionParams[_collection].canExecute;
        emit CollectionShutdownCancelled(_collection);
    }
```
