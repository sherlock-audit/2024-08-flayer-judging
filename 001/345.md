# The remaining collateral validation is incorrect when the  function adjustPosition is called to increase debt for a tokenid of a collection.

## Summary
 The  function adjustPosition is called to increase/decrease  debt for a tokenid of a collection.The remaining collateral validation is incorrect when the  function adjustPosition is called to increase debt for a tokenid of a collection, as a result, a user can call multiple times the  function adjustPosition to drain/steal collateral token of a collection in the  ProtectedListings contract.

## root cause
it checks  if (_amount > debt) revert InsufficientCollateral(); but it should check in this way i.e remaining collateral = MAX_PROTECTED_TOKEN_AMOUNT - debt, so  if (_amount > remaining collateral) revert InsufficientCollateral();


## Vulnerability Detail
1. Let’s assume, alice has listed a tokenid of a collection in the ProtectedListings contract. The tokenid’s debt = 0.85, Available collateral to withdraw = 0.95-0.85 = 0.10.

2. Now Alice wants to increase debt , so Alice calls the function adjustPosition with 0.75 _amount for the tokenid.

3. See the function adjustPosition, here   if (_amount > debt) revert InsufficientCollateral();  now as _amount < debt i.e 0.75<0.85 so the function will not revert and alice will get 0.75 collateral amount from the ProtectedListings contract.

4. Now alice’s  _protectedListings[_collection][_tokenId].tokenTaken = 0.85+0.75 = 1.60(which is greater than   MAX_PROTECTED_TOKEN_AMOUNT i.e 0.95 ether.

5.  Now alice calls multiple times the function adjustPosition to drain the collateral token (alice calls in a way so that _amonut<debt and steals the collateral token from ProtectedListings ).


## Impact
a user can call multiple times the  function adjustPosition to drain/steal collateral token of a collection in the  ProtectedListings contract.

## Recommendation
 check like this i.e remaining collateral = MAX_PROTECTED_TOKEN_AMOUNT - debt, so  if (_amount > remaining collateral) revert InsufficientCollateral();
