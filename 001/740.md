# `_createCheckpoint()` will run twice in ProtectedListings:createListings() but it is meant to run only once

## Summary
`_createCheckpoint()` will run twice in ProtectedListings:createListings() but it is meant to run only once

## Vulnerability Detail
When a tokenId of a collection is protectedListed for the first time then it calls `_createCheckpoint()` and it stores the checkPointIndex
```solidity
 function createListings(CreateListing[] calldata _createListings) public nonReentrant lockerNotPaused {
//
            // Update our checkpoint for the collection if it has not been done yet for
            // the listing collection.
            checkpointKey = keccak256(abi.encodePacked('checkpointIndex', listing.collection));
            assembly { checkpointIndex := tload(checkpointKey) }
            if (checkpointIndex == 0) {
>               checkpointIndex = _createCheckpoint(listing.collection);
                assembly { tstore(checkpointKey, checkpointIndex) }
            }
//
    }
```
But the problem is, if we see _createCheckpoint(), it returns the `index = 0` for the first time calling, which means tstore will store again 0 at `checkpointKey`. As result, it will run again but it should not.
```solidity
function _createCheckpoint(address _collection) internal returns (uint index_) {
//
        // If this is our first checkpoint, then our logic will be different as we won't have
        // a previous checkpoint to compare against and we don't want to underflow the index.
        if (index_ == 0) {
            // Calculate the current interest rate based on utilization
            (, uint _utilizationRate) = utilizationRate(_collection);

            // We don't have a previous checkpoint to calculate against, so we initiate our
            // first checkpoint with base data.
            collectionCheckpoints[_collection].push(
                Checkpoint({
                    compoundedFactor: locker.taxCalculator().calculateCompoundedFactor({
                        _previousCompoundedFactor: 1e18,
                        _utilizationRate: _utilizationRate,
                        _timePeriod: 0
                    }),
                    timestamp: block.timestamp
                })
            );

>           return index_;
//
        }
```

## Impact
It will create wrong checkPoint by running twice

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Return `index_++`, if the checkpoint is create for the first time of that collection
