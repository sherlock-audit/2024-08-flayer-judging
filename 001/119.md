# Voters lose their tokens due to misconfiguration in `cancel` function

### Summary

When a shutdown has passed the quorum and `canExecute` = true but we didn't call the `execute` function and got some liquidity now we want to cancel the shutdown process calling `cancel` function  
we Remove our execution flag `delete _collectionParams[_collection];` and users can't either get their tokens nor the equivalent.

### Root Cause

Missing implementation in `cancel` function to restore tokens for the voters.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A user calls `start` to shut down the collection.
2. Collection reaches the criteria to be shut.
3. We added some liquidity and want to cancel the shutdown.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A user calls `start` to shut down the collection.
2. Collection reaches the criteria to be shut.
3. we added some liquidity and want to cancel the shutdown.
4. `cancel` function would execute removing execution flag
5. There is no implementation in `cancel` to give back users their votes or their tokens.
6. Users can't call `reclaimVote` because `_collectionParams[_collection]` is deleted in `cancel`

### Impact

Loss of funds.

### PoC

1. A user calls `CollectionShutdown::start` to start a shutdown.

[CollectionShutdown.sol#L135-L151](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L135-L151)

```solidity
File: CollectionShutdown.sol
135:     function start(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
////code
143:         // Get the total number of tokens still in circulation, specifying a maximum number
144:         // of tokens that can be present in a "dormant" collection.
145:@>       params.collectionToken = locker.collectionToken(_collection);
```

2. To execute the shutdown we need to have enough votes so users get votes and give their tokens to the contract in `vote` function.

This function transfer user palance to the shutdown contract and give him a share of votes.

[CollectionShutdown.sol#L191-L204](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L191-L204)

```solidity
File: CollectionShutdown.sol
191:     function _vote(address _collection, CollectionShutdownParams memory params) internal returns (CollectionShutdownParams memory) {
192:         // Take tokens from the user and hold them in this escrow contract
193:         uint userVotes = params.collectionToken.balanceOf(msg.sender);
194:         if (userVotes == 0) revert UserHoldsNoTokens();
195: 
196:         // Pull our tokens in from the user
197:@>       params.collectionToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), userVotes);
198: 
199:         // Register the amount of votes sent as a whole, and store them against the user
200:         params.shutdownVotes += uint96(userVotes);
201: 
202:         // Register the amount of votes for the collection against the user
203:         unchecked { shutdownVoters[_collection][msg.sender] += userVotes; };=
////code 
207:         // If we can execute, then we need to fire another event
208:         if (!params.canExecute && params.shutdownVotes >= params.quorumVotes) {
209:@>            params.canExecute = true;
```

Considering `params.canExecute=true`.

3. We have added some liquidity for the Collection and want to cancel the shutdown.

This function check if  
- `canExecute=true` to make sure we can execute

- We have enough total supply  
    Then it will remove the execution flag.

[CollectionShutdown.sol#L390-L403](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L390-L403)

```solidity
File: CollectionShutdown.sol
390:     function cancel(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
391:         // Ensure that the vote count has reached quorum
392:         CollectionShutdownParams memory params = _collectionParams[_collection];
393:@>       if (!params.canExecute) revert ShutdownNotReachedQuorum();
394: 
395:         // Check if the total supply has surpassed an amount of the initial required
396:         // total supply. This would indicate that a collection has grown since the
397:         // initial shutdown was triggered and could result in an unsuspected liquidation.
398:@>       if (params.collectionToken.totalSupply() <= MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS * 10 ** locker.collectionToken(_collection).denomination()) {
399:             revert InsufficientTotalSupplyToCancel();
400:         }
401: 
402:         // Remove our execution flag
403:@>      delete _collectionParams[_collection];
404:        emit CollectionShutdownCancelled(_collection);
```

Deleting `_collectionParams[_collection]` makes the users unable to get back their tokens, since in Line 369 it will cause panic revert underflow.

We are no longer can't call `reclaimVote` which should give users their tokens back.

[CollectionShutdown.sol#L356-L374](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L356-L374)

```solidity
File: CollectionShutdown.sol
356:     function reclaimVote(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
357:         // If the quorum has passed, then we can no longer reclaim as we are pending
358:         // an execution.
359:@>       CollectionShutdownParams storage params = _collectionParams[_collection];
360:         if (params.canExecute) revert ShutdownQuorumHasPassed();
361: 
362:         // Get the amount of votes that the user has cast for this collection
363:         uint userVotes = shutdownVoters[_collection][msg.sender];
364: 
365:         // If the user has not cast a vote, then we can revert early
366:         if (userVotes == 0) revert NoVotesPlacedYet();
367: 
368:         // We delete the votes that the user has attributed to the collection
369:         params.shutdownVotes -= uint96(userVotes);
370:         delete shutdownVoters[_collection][msg.sender];
371: 
372:         // We can now return their tokens
373:@>       params.collectionToken.transfer(msg.sender, userVotes);
```

And for sure can't call `claim` because no execution of shutdown happened.

Users funds stucked forever in this contract.

### Mitigation

Add proper implementation in `cancel` to resend tokens back to the voters.
