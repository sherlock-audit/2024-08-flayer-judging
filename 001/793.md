# Unintended Tax Refund for Liquidation Listings in Relist Function

## Summary

The relist function in the Listings contract does not differentiate between regular listings and liquidation listings when processing tax refunds. This oversight could lead to unintended tax refunds being issued for liquidation listings, which should not receive any refunds.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the relist function, tax refunds are processed for all listings without checking if they are liquidation listings:

````solidity
 
function relist(CreateListing calldata _listing, bool _payTaxWithEscrow) public nonReentrant lockerNotPaused {
    // ...
    (uint _fees,) = _resolveListingTax(oldListing, _collection, true);
    if (_fees != 0) {
        emit ListingFeeCaptured(_collection, _tokenId, _fees);
    }
    // ...
}
```` 

Test:
````solidity
    function test_refuntToLiqLists() public {
        // Set our keeper address
        address payable _owner = users[1];
        address keeperAddress = address(10);

        uint _tokenId = 0;

        erc721a.mint(_owner, _tokenId);
        vm.startPrank(_owner);

        // Provide the user with sufficient ERC20 to fulfill the partial adjustment
        deal(
            address(locker.collectionToken(address(erc721a))),
            address(this),
            1 ether
        );

        locker.collectionToken(address(erc721a)).approve(
            address(protectedListings),
            1 ether
        );

        // Create our listing
        erc721a.approve(address(protectedListings), _tokenId);
        _createProtectedListing({
            _listing: IProtectedListings.CreateListing({
                collection: address(erc721a),
                tokenIds: _tokenIdToArray(_tokenId),
                listing: IProtectedListings.ProtectedListing({
                    owner: _owner,
                    tokenTaken: 0.5 ether,
                    checkpoint: 0
                })
            })
        });

        // Warp forward to a point at which the collateral available is negative
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + LIQUIDATION_TIME);
        vm.stopPrank();
        // Trigger our liquidation
        vm.prank(keeperAddress);
        protectedListings.liquidateProtectedListing(address(erc721a), _tokenId);

        locker.collectionToken(address(erc721a)).approve(
            address(listings),
            type(uint).max
        );
        address token = address(locker.collectionToken(address(erc721a)));
        deal(token, address(this), type(uint).max);
        emit log_uint(listings.balances(_owner, address(token)));
        listings.relist(
            IListings.CreateListing({
                collection: address(erc721a),
                tokenIds: _tokenIdToArray(_tokenId),
                listing: IListings.Listing({
                    owner: payable(address(this)),
                    created: uint40(block.timestamp),
                    duration: listings.MIN_LIQUID_DURATION(),
                    floorMultiple: 500
                })
            }),
            false
        );
        emit log_uint(listings.balances(_owner, address(token)));
    }
```

## Impact

This vulnerability could lead to financial losses for the protocol. Liquidation listings, which are created when a protected listing is liquidated, should not receive tax refunds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a check to differentiate between regular listings and liquidation listings before processing tax refunds.
