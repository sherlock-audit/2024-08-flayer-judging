# Protected listings checkpoints are not always updated when the total supply changes

### Summary

The protocol doesn't update protected listings checkpoints every time the total supply of collection token changes

### Root Cause

The `ProtectedListing` contract uses a checkpoint system to keep track of the interests to pay. It calculates the current interest rate of a collection based on the [utilization rate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L261), which depends, among other factors, on the total supply of collection tokens.

For this system to work correctly everytime the total supply changes a new checkpoint for the collection should be created, but this is not the case as both [Locker::deposit()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L261) and [Locker::redeem()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L198), which mint and burn collection tokens, don't create a new checkpoint in the protected listing contract.

Another case where this happens is the [UniswapImplementation::afterSwap()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/UniswapImplementation.sol#L617) hook, where collection tokens can be burned.

### Attack Path

This is a problem by itself, as users will pay a wrong interest rate, but it can also be taken advantage of to force users to pay a huge amount of interest or get their protected listings liquidated:

1. Alice creates a new protected listing via [ProtectedListings::createListings()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L117). This is the first protected listing of the collection and as such she expects a low interest rate.
2. Eve, a liquidity provider, flashloans all of the collection tokens currently in the UniswapV4 pool.
3. Eve calls [Locker::redeem()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L209) in order to burn all of the flashloaned collection tokens in the exchange for NFTs. This lowers the total supply of collection tokens and increases the utilization rate.
4. Eve calls [Listings::cancelListings()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L414) by passing as an emppty array as token ids. This creates a checkpoint for the collection.
5. Eve calls [Locker::deposit()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L132) in order to re-deposit the NFT collected during point `3` in exchange for collection tokens.
6. Eve adds the collection tokens back the UniV4 pool.

This results in Alice having to pay a higher interest rate than expected, which is profitable for Eve, or have her NFT liquidated if the interest rate is so high that the position becomes liquidatable in much less time than she expects.

The worst situation possible is for Alice to create a protected listing by borrowing `1` wei of tokens in a collection that's just been created and whose whole total supply is locked in the UniwapV4 pool. Eve would be able to create a situation where:

1. The total supply is `1` (Alice's borrowed token)
2. The amount of listings is `1` (Alice's listing)

which would result in an utilization rate of:
> (listingsOfType_ * 1e36 * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination()) / totalSupply

> (1 * 1e36 * 10 ** 0) / 1

> 1e36

### Impact

Since the checkpoints are not correctly updated users will pay a wrong interest rate on protected listings no-matter-what. An attacker can abuse this artificially inflate the utilization rate, which is profitable when the attacker is also a liquidity provider in the UniV4 pool.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Correctly update collection checkpoints whenever the total supply of collection token changes.
