# In `Listings::reserve()` undeleted Listings will cause stealing of funds

### Summary

`Listings::reserve()` doesn't delete the original `_listings` mapping of NFT, if the reserved token gets deposited in `Locker` then the initial owner can call `Listings::cancelListings()` refunding to him fees of the listings for the second time 

### Root Cause

undeleted `_listings` mapping of NFT token after its reserved

### Internal pre-conditions

Token to be listed initially.

### External pre-conditions

Another user comes and reserve the listed token,then he unlocks the protected listing then he deposit it into locker before the full duration of the original listing gets passed

### Attack Path

1. User A List his NFT for 7 days and the fees are accounted for
2. User B comes in day 1 and reserve it, Fees paid by User A are refunded (6 days refund) + he gets paid the above floor price
3. User B call `unlockProtectedListing` with the money needed
4. User B decides that he doesn't want the NFT and deposit it into `Locker` after 1 day of purchase
5. We are now 2 days after User A listed his NFT, User A calls `Listings::cancelListings()` of the same Token that User B have reserved before, `cancelListing()` call go through refunding User A again 5 days of fees of his duration and giving him back the NFT token retrieved from the Locker. (user will have to pay floor value to get NFT token back to him but this is out of our interest here)  

In the above way User A has got refunded fees two times, causing loss of funds(`collectionToken`) and there will be times where the contract doesn't have enough balance to call [`depositFees`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L377) calls causing any instance of functions doing that call to revert due to actual balance present in contract will be less that the accounted for

### Impact

Loss of funds from Listings contract and the accounting of fees gets corrupted compared to current balance and any filled listing that will call `implementation.depositFees()` will revert to due contract running put of balance

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Delete the listings in `reserve()` function
