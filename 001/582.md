# ```CollectionShutdown::execute()``` calculates the ```newQuorum``` before burning ```Locker```'s collection tokens leading to unfair ETH distribution and lost funds forever.

### Summary

During the execution of a collection's shutdown on ```CollectionShutdown``` contract, the ```execute()``` calculates the ```newQuorum``` taking into consideration the ```collectionToken```s of the ```Locker``` but then burn them leading to lost funds for ever since a portion of ETH accumulated from the liquidation will never be collected.

### Root Cause

In ```CollectionShutdown::execute()``` the order of the calculations and calls inside the function results to loss of funds. The root cause is that :

1) Firstly, the ```quorum```(how the total amount of ```ETH``` that will be collected from the liquidation) is calculated **with** the ```CollectionToken``` of the ```Locker``` contract.
2) Instantly after this and during the ```Locker::sunsetCollection()```, the ```CollectionToken``` that the contract holds are burned from the total supply.

However, the equivalent ```ETH``` will be waited to be collected when the liquidation completes but the tokens are burned so the other LPs will take a cut for an amount that will be never collected.

We can see the code here :
```solidity
    function execute(address _collection, uint[] calldata _tokenIds) public onlyOwner whenNotPaused {
       // ...

        // Refresh total supply here to ensure that any assets that were added during
        // the shutdown process can also claim their share.
@>        uint newQuorum = params.collectionToken.totalSupply() * SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT / ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT;
        if (params.quorumVotes != newQuorum) {
            params.quorumVotes = uint88(newQuorum);
        }

        // Lockdown the collection to prevent any new interaction
@>        locker.sunsetCollection(_collection);

        // ...
    } 
```

And we, also, see the ```Locker::sunsetCollection()``` which burns the corresponding ```CollectionToken```s :
```solidity
    function sunsetCollection(address _collection) public collectionExists(_collection) {
        // Ensure that only our {CollectionShutdown} contract can call this
        if (msg.sender != address(collectionShutdown)) revert InvalidCaller();

        // cache
        ICollectionToken collectionToken_ = _collectionToken[_collection];

        // Burn our held tokens to remove any contract bloat
@>        collectionToken_.burn(collectionToken_.balanceOf(address(this)));

        // Notify our stalkers that the collection has been sunset
        emit CollectionSunset(_collection, address(collectionToken_), msg.sender);

        // Delete our underlying token, then no deposits or actions can be made
        delete _collectionToken[_collection];

        // Remove our `collectionInitialized` flag
        delete collectionInitialized[_collection];
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A collection is about to be shut down by admin calling ```CollectionShutdown::execute()```.
2. Some ```collectionTokens```  to be in ```Locker``` contract.

### External pre-conditions

No external pre-conditions.

### Attack Path

1. Collection's shut down gets started from ```CollectionShutdown::start()``` due to low liquidity of collection tokens.
2. Collection's shut down gets executed from ```CollectionShutdown::execute()```  because the old ```quorum``` was reached.
3. During the ```execution```, a new ```quorum``` is calculated with the ```totalSupply``` of ```CollectionToken``` so all holders to be able to get their portion of the ```ETH``` collected from the liquidation.
4. After it's calculation and, still, during the ```execution``` the ```CollectionToken``` of the ```Locker``` contract are burned. However, they have been taken into consideration in the new ```quorum``` which was just before calculated with them inside.
5. Now, this portion of ```ETH``` from the ```CollectionToken```s that got burned will never be collected.

### Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is that the ```ETH``` accumulated from the liquidation of the collection are distributed **unfairly**, since ```LP```s suffer a cut on their portion without being able to collect an amount of ```ETH``` that would be never be taken since the equivalent ```CollectionToken```s have been burned from the ```Locker```. Furthermore, and more seriously, there is **loss of funds** since this amount of ```ETH``` belongs to the ```Flayer``` but, instead, it will remain on the ```SudoPool``` uncollected.

### PoC

No PoC needed.

### Mitigation

To mitigate this issue and guarantee a fair ```ETH``` distribution, you have to make this change on the calls' order : 
```diff
    function execute(address _collection, uint[] calldata _tokenIds) public onlyOwner whenNotPaused {
        // ...

-        // Refresh total supply here to ensure that any assets that were added during
-        // the shutdown process can also claim their share.
-        uint newQuorum = params.collectionToken.totalSupply() * SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT / ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT;
-        if (params.quorumVotes != newQuorum) {
-            params.quorumVotes = uint88(newQuorum);
-        }

-       // Lockdown the collection to prevent any new interaction
-        locker.sunsetCollection(_collection);

+       // Lockdown the collection to prevent any new interaction
+        locker.sunsetCollection(_collection);

+        // Refresh total supply here to ensure that any assets that were added during
+        // the shutdown process can also claim their share.
+        uint newQuorum = params.collectionToken.totalSupply() * SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT / ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT;
+        if (params.quorumVotes != newQuorum) {
+            params.quorumVotes = uint88(newQuorum);
+        }
        // ...
    }
```
