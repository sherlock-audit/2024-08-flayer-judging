# `CollectionShutdown::execute(...)` can be permanently bricked thus blocking liquidation for a collection

### Summary

The `CollectionShutdown::execute(...)` can be ricked by anyone this preventing the shutdown of a collection leading to a DOS
- preventing the shutdown of the collection and by extension creation of sweeper pools for liquidation

### Root Cause

The `Listing::relist(...)` function allows a user to relist a listing with a future date thus making the listing unavailable until the listing future date has passed. 
Meanwhile [`execute(...)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L231-L241) function checks that the collection currently has no listing by calling [`_hasListings(_collection)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L497-L502) which returns `true` provided that the `listingCount != 0`.  The function reverts and liquidations cannot be done

```solidity
File: CollectionShutdown.sol
231:     function execute(address _collection, uint[] calldata _tokenIds) public onlyOwner whenNotPaused {
SNIP      ........
239: 
240:         // Check that no listings currently exist @audit (2X) create a listing for 1.01x and relist it be making listing start external such that it cannot be relisted because ot is unavailable
241:    @>   if (_hasListings(_collection)) revert ListingsExist();
248:         }

262:         // Map our collection to a newly created pair
263:  @>     address pool = _createSudoswapPool(collection, _tokenIds);

```

Also notice from below that when `relist(...)` calls  [`_validateCreateListing(..)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L262-L293) that `listing.created` is not validated to be nearby date from the point of creating the listing

```solidity
625:     function relist(CreateListing calldata _listing, bool _payTaxWithEscrow) public nonReentrant lockerNotPaused {
626:         // Load our tokenId
SNIP        ..............
660: 
661:         // Validate our new listing
662:  @>     _validateCreateListing(_listing); 

```


Notice from below on LL487 and L698 that the listing cannot be [reserved](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L698-L699) or [filled](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L485-L487) if it is unavailable.


```solidity
File: Listings.sol
485:     function _fillListing(address _collection, address _collectionToken, uint _tokenId) private {
486:         // Get our listing information
487:    @>   (bool isAvailable, uint price) = getListingPrice(_collection, _tokenId);

...

690:     function reserve(address _collection, uint _tokenId, uint _collateral) public nonReentrant lockerNotPaused {
691:         // Read the existing listing in a single read
692:         Listing memory oldListing = _listings[_collection][_tokenId];
693: 
694:         // Ensure the caller is not the owner of the listing
695:         if (oldListing.owner == msg.sender) revert CallerIsAlreadyOwner();
696: 
697:         // Ensure that the existing listing is available
698:  @>     (bool isAvailable, uint listingPrice) = getListingPrice(_collection, _tokenId);


826:     function getListingPrice(address _collection, uint _tokenId) public view returns (bool isAvailable_, uint price_) {
SNIP         ..............
854: 
855:         // This is an edge case, but protects against potential future logic. If the
856:         // listing starts in the future, then we can't sell the listing.
857:    @>   if (listing.created > block.timestamp) {
858:             return (isAvailable_, totalPrice);
859:         }
860: 

```

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- Alice has 2 accounts A and B
- account A creates a listing with a `floorMultiple` = 1.01x
- account B calls `relist(..)` with `floorMultiple` = 1.02x and `Listing.created` set to a far future date (could be years form the point of relisting)  making the listing unavailable.
- Admin calls `execute(...)` but it reverts because `_hasListings(_collection)` returns `true`

### Impact

`CollectionShutdown::execute(...)` can be DOS'd, thus 
- preventing the lockdown of the collection to prevent any new interaction
- blocking liquidations because sweeper pools cannot be deployed for a newly created pair 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider validating the ``Listing.created` of a user  when performing the relisting to ensure that token can be available to within a short time after relisting
