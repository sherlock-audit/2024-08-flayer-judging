# Inefficient Checkpoint Creation Leading to Inaccurate Compounding Calculations

## Summary
The `_createCheckpoint` function in the `ProtectedListings` contract can create checkpoints without verifying if sufficient time has passed since the last checkpoint. This inefficiency can lead to unnecessary storage use and inaccurate compounding calculations, potentially affecting the financial integrity of the system.

## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the lack of a time check before creating a new checkpoint. The function does not verify if there has been a significant time lapse since the previous checkpoint, leading to redundant checkpoints and potentially incorrect compounding calculations.
```solidity
530:     function _createCheckpoint(address _collection) internal returns (uint index_) {
---
532:         index_ = collectionCheckpoints[_collection].length;
533: 
---
535:         emit CheckpointCreated(_collection, index_);
536: 
---
539:         if (index_ == 0) {
---
541:             (, uint _utilizationRate) = utilizationRate(_collection);
542: 
---
545:             collectionCheckpoints[_collection].push(
546:                 Checkpoint({
547:                     compoundedFactor: locker.taxCalculator().calculateCompoundedFactor({
548:                         _previousCompoundedFactor: 1e18,
549:                         _utilizationRate: _utilizationRate,
550:                         _timePeriod: 0
551:                     }),
552:                     timestamp: block.timestamp
553:                 })
554:             );
555: 
---
556:             return index_;
557:         }
558: 
---
560:         Checkpoint memory checkpoint = _currentCheckpoint(_collection);
561: 
---
564:         if (checkpoint.timestamp == collectionCheckpoints[_collection][index_ - 1].timestamp) {
565:             collectionCheckpoints[_collection][index_ - 1].compoundedFactor = checkpoint.compoundedFactor;
566:             return index_;
567:         }
568: 
---
570:         collectionCheckpoints[_collection].push(checkpoint);
571:     }
```

## Impact
- Unnecessary checkpoints consume storage space, leading to increased costs and potential performance degradation.
- If compounded factors are calculated without adequate time intervals, it could result in incorrect interest or fee calculations.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a time check to ensure that a significant period has elapsed before creating a new checkpoint. This can be done by comparing the current timestamp with the timestamp of the last checkpoint.
```diff
function _createCheckpoint(address _collection) internal returns (uint index_) {

    index_ = collectionCheckpoints[_collection].length;

    emit CheckpointCreated(_collection, index_);

    if (index_ == 0) {

        (, uint _utilizationRate) = utilizationRate(_collection);

        collectionCheckpoints[_collection].push(

            Checkpoint({

                compoundedFactor: locker.taxCalculator().calculateCompoundedFactor({

                    _previousCompoundedFactor: 1e18,

                    _utilizationRate: _utilizationRate,

                    _timePeriod: 0

                }),

                timestamp: block.timestamp

            })

        );

        return index_;

    }

    Checkpoint memory checkpoint = _currentCheckpoint(_collection);

-   if (checkpoint.timestamp == collectionCheckpoints[_collection][index_ - 1].timestamp) {

-       collectionCheckpoints[_collection][index_ - 1].compoundedFactor = checkpoint.compoundedFactor;

    // Ensure a significant amount of time has passed since the last checkpoint

+   if (block.timestamp - collectionCheckpoints[_collection][index_ - 1].timestamp < MIN_TIME_INTERVAL) {

        return index_; // Exit early if not enough time has passed

    }

    collectionCheckpoints[_collection].push(checkpoint);

}
```
