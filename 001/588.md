# The function `reserve` does not perform `createCheckpoint`, resulting in compoundedFactor being unable to correctly reflect the actual situation.

### Summary

In the design of the contract, when the utilization changes, a checkpoint needs to be created to reflect the change. Also mentioned in the comments: 

> Create our checkpoint as utilisation rates will change

In the reserve function, since the `totalSupply` of `collectionToken` will change, the utilizationRate will also change.

```solidity
        // Burn the tokens that the user provided as collateral, as we will have it minted
        // from {ProtectedListings}.
        collectionToken.burnFrom(msg.sender, _collateral * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination());
        
        // We should now have received the non-collateral assets, which we will burn in
        // addition to the amount that the user sent us.
        collectionToken.burn((1 ether - _collateral) * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination());
```

```solidity
    function utilizationRate(address _collection) public view virtual returns (uint listingsOfType_, uint utilizationRate_) {
        // Get the count of active listings of the specified listing type
        listingsOfType_ = listingCount[_collection];

        // If we have listings of this type then we need to calculate the percentage, otherwise
        // we will just return a zero percent value.
        if (listingsOfType_ != 0) {
            ICollectionToken collectionToken = locker.collectionToken(_collection);

            // If we have no totalSupply, then we have a zero percent utilization
            uint totalSupply = collectionToken.totalSupply();
            if (totalSupply != 0) {
                utilizationRate_ = (listingsOfType_ * 1e36 * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination()) / totalSupply;
            }
        }
    }
```

However, the reserve function does not perform the createCheckpoint operation.

### Root Cause

In `Listings.sol#reserve`, it does not perform `createCheckpoint`.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. There are some listings in the _collection.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The user calls `reserve`

### Impact

The `compoundedFactor` will be a wrong value.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add createCheckpoint in the function `reserve`.
