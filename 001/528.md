# Malicious user can exploit stale listings to gain undue refunds, impacting protocol funds and listing integrity

### Summary

The failure to delete old listings in `reserve` when creating protected listings will cause an unintended refund vulnerability for malicious users as they can exploit stale listing data through the relist and modify functions without actual NFT transfers.


### Root Cause

In the reserve function of the Listings contract, there is a critical oversight where the old listing is not deleted when converting it to a protected listing. This contrasts with other functions like cancelListings and fillListing which properly handle listing deletion.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L690-L759

In the reserve function:

```solidity
function reserve(address _collection, uint _tokenId, uint _collateral) public nonReentrant lockerNotPaused {
    // ... (other code)

    // Read the existing listing in a single read
    Listing memory oldListing = _listings[_collection][_tokenId];

    // ... (process the conversion to protected listing)

    // Reduce the amount of listings
    unchecked { listingCount[_collection] -= 1; }

    // Missing: Should delete the old listing here
    // delete _listings[_collection][_tokenId];

    // ... (create protected listing)
}
```
The function decrements the listingCount but fails to delete the actual listing data.

Contrast this with cancelListings, which properly deletes the listing:

```solidity
function cancelListings(address _collection, uint[] memory _tokenIds, bool _payTaxWithEscrow) public lockerNotPaused {
    // ... (other code)

    // Delete the listing objects
    delete _listings[_collection][_tokenId];

    // ... (other code)
}
```
The missing deletion in reserve leaves stale listing data in the contract's storage, which can be exploited in functions that assume the integrity of listing data, such as relist and modifyListings.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker creates a regular listing for their NFT
2. Attacker converts the regular listing to a protected listing using `reserve` call.
3. Attacker unlocks the protected listing immediately paying minimal fee
4. Attacker calls modify function with the same NFT which is actually not longer listed
5. The contract processes a tax refund for the stale listing data
6. Attacker repeats steps 4-5 multiple times to accumulate undue refunds

### Impact

An attacker could modify stale listings to receive refunds or manipulate fees without owning the actual NFTs. For example, exploitation in modifyListings, where tax tokens will be refunded to the owner in _resolveListingTax
```solidity
function modifyListings(address _collection, ModifyListing[] calldata _modifyListings, bool _payTaxWithEscrow) public nonReentrant lockerNotPaused returns (uint taxRequired_, uint refund_) {
    // ... (other code)

    // Collect tax on the existing listing
    (uint _fees, uint _refund) = _resolveListingTax(listing, _collection, false);
    emit ListingFeeCaptured(_collection, params.tokenId, _fees);

    fees += _fees;
    refund_ += _refund;

    // ... (other code)
}
```
