# In CollectionShutdown, an attacker can manipulate voting



## Summary
The attackers manipulated the vote to advance it.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `CollectionShutdown`, use the `collectionToken` to vote:

```solidity
    function _vote(address _collection, CollectionShutdownParams memory params) internal returns (CollectionShutdownParams memory) {
        // Take tokens from the user and hold them in this escrow contract
        uint userVotes = params.collectionToken.balanceOf(msg.sender);
        if (userVotes == 0) revert UserHoldsNoTokens();

        // Pull our tokens in from the user
@>      params.collectionToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), userVotes);

        // Register the amount of votes sent as a whole, and store them against the user
@>      params.shutdownVotes += uint96(userVotes);

        // Register the amount of votes for the collection against the user
        unchecked { shutdownVoters[_collection][msg.sender] += userVotes; }

        emit CollectionShutdownVote(_collection, msg.sender, userVotes);

        // If we can execute, then we need to fire another event
        if (!params.canExecute && params.shutdownVotes >= params.quorumVotes) {
            params.canExecute = true;
            emit CollectionShutdownQuorumReached(_collection);
        }

        return params;
    }
```


The problem is, once you start voting, you can still mint collectionToken:

```solidity
    function deposit(address _collection, uint[] calldata _tokenIds, address _recipient) public
        nonReentrant
        whenNotPaused
        collectionExists(_collection)
    {
        uint tokenIdsLength = _tokenIds.length;
        if (tokenIdsLength == 0) revert NoTokenIds();

        // Define our collection token outside the loop
        IERC721 collection = IERC721(_collection);

        // Take the ERC721 tokens from the caller
        for (uint i; i < tokenIdsLength; ++i) {
            // Transfer the collection token from the caller to the locker
            collection.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _tokenIds[i]);
        }

        // Mint the tokens to the recipient
        ICollectionToken token = _collectionToken[_collection];
@>      token.mint(_recipient, tokenIdsLength * 1 ether * 10 ** token.denomination());

        emit TokenDeposit(_collection, _tokenIds, msg.sender, _recipient);
    }
```

So malicious users can manipulate voting,
Assume that for a certain collection, most token holders do not want to enter the `shutdown state`. After voting start, no voting is conducted, so the `shutdown state` will not be entered.
But if there is a malicious user, at this time mint a large number of tokens, and then vote, will let the vote pass into the `shutdown state`, which is not desired by other users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
After voting begins, disable mint tokens, or use snapshots.
