# Inability to shutdown/sunset a newly registered collection after previous shutdown

## Summary

The `shutdownVotes` parameter is not cleared after a collection shutdown is executed and claimed. This issue prevents a previously shut down collection from being eligible for a new shutdown/sunset process if it is re-registered.

## Vulnerability Detail

When the `CollectionShutdown` contract executes and then the claim process occurs, it fails to update or clear the `shutdownVotes` parameter, which is used to track votes related to the shutdown process.

```solidity
File: CollectionShutdown.sol
285:     function claim(address _collection, address payable _claimant) public nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
286:         // Ensure our user has tokens to claim
287:         uint claimableVotes = shutdownVoters[_collection][_claimant];
288:         if (claimableVotes == 0) revert NoTokensAvailableToClaim();
289: 
290:         // Ensure that we have moved token IDs to the pool
291:         CollectionShutdownParams memory params = _collectionParams[_collection];
292:         if (params.sweeperPool == address(0)) revert ShutdownNotExecuted();
293: 
294:         // Ensure that all NFTs have sold from our Sudoswap pool
295:         if (!collectionLiquidationComplete(_collection)) revert NotAllTokensSold();
296: 
297:         // We can now delete our sweeper pool tokenIds
298:         if (params.sweeperPoolTokenIds.length != 0) {
299:             delete _collectionParams[_collection].sweeperPoolTokenIds;
300:         }
301: 
302:         // Burn the tokens from our supply
303:         params.collectionToken.burn(claimableVotes);
304: 
305:         // Set our available tokens to claim to zero
306:         delete shutdownVoters[_collection][_claimant];
307: 
308:         // Get the number of votes from the claimant and the total supply and determine from that the percentage
309:         // of the available funds that they are able to claim.
310:         uint amount = params.availableClaim * claimableVotes / (params.quorumVotes * ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT / SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT);
311:         (bool sent,) = _claimant.call{value: amount}('');
312:         if (!sent) revert FailedToClaim();
313: 
314:         emit CollectionShutdownClaim(_collection, _claimant, claimableVotes, amount);
315:     }
```

If a collection that was previously shut down is re-registered with the `Locker`, it will not be eligible for a new shutdown/sunset process because the `shutdownVotes` from the previous shutdown remain unchanged.

```solidity
File: CollectionShutdown.sol
135:     function start(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
136:         // Confirm that this collection is not prevented from being shutdown
137:         if (shutdownPrevented[_collection]) revert ShutdownPrevented();
138: 
139:         // Ensure that a shutdown process is not already actioned
140:         CollectionShutdownParams memory params = _collectionParams[_collection];
141:@>       if (params.shutdownVotes != 0) revert ShutdownProcessAlreadyStarted();
---
157:     }
```

## Impact

Prevents the `CollectionShutdown` contract from correctly processing a **new** shutdown/sunset request for a collection that has been previously shut down. This results in the collection being unable to be shut down again, even if it is re-registered.

## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation

Update the `params.shutdownVoters` when claiming to reduce global votes. 


```diff
function claim(address _collection, address payable _claimant) public nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    // Ensure our user has tokens to claim
    uint claimableVotes = shutdownVoters[_collection][_claimant];
    if (claimableVotes == 0) revert NoTokensAvailableToClaim();
---

+   params.shutdownVotes -= claimableVotes;

    emit CollectionShutdownClaim(_collection, _claimant, claimableVotes, amount);
}
```

```diff
function reclaimVote(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
    // If the quorum has passed, then we can no longer reclaim as we are pending
    // an execution.
    CollectionShutdownParams storage params = _collectionParams[_collection];
    if (params.canExecute) revert ShutdownQuorumHasPassed();
+   if (params.sweeperPool != address(0)) revert ShutdownExecuted(); // prevent from reclaim after executed
---
}
```

However, **this approach raises another concern**: the `params.shutdownVoters` represents votes from users, which could potentially lead to an imbalance in the total value relative to the supply. 

In a scenario where all claimers reclaim their votes, `params.shutdownVoters` would revert to zero, enabling a new shutdown process. However, users who hold collection tokens but havenâ€™t voted (or claimed via [`CollectionShutdown::voteAndClaim()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L323-L348)) will be affected. 

If the collection is re-registered and undergoes another shutdown, those non-voting users could lose the ability to claim rewards, as new tokens might be minted for the re-registered collection, leaving their tokens unaccounted for.

This concern should be evaluated based on the specific business logic in place.
