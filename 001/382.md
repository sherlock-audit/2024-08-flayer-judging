# DOS to `withdrawProtectedListing`

## Summary
Root cause : weak locker validation on `locker.isListing`
Impact: The unlocked user cannot withdraw his NFT, and also the NFT that attacker swapped his NFT into unlocker user's, will forever be locked in the Locker. So loss of funds to protected listing unlocker.

See recommendation section for faster understanding.
## Vulnerability Detail

Issue flow :
1. The user has already created a protected listing on BAYC 25
2. Then after 2 days wants to unlock it and withdraw the nft by paying the debt, so he calls `ProtectedListings.unlockProtectedListing` with `bool _withdraw = false`, so BAYC 25 is still inside the locker contract and he can withdraw it by calling `withdrawProtectedListing` whenever he likes because on line 306 below `canWithdrawAsset` is set to the user.
3. then after few hours, user will call `withdrawProtectedListing` to withdraw his BAYC 25. But it will revert on line 337 which will call `Locker.withdrawToken`
4. It reverts becasue BAYC 25 is not inside the locker, someone swapped BAYC 100 to BAYC 25 in between the user's unlock_protected_listing and this call's withdraw listing.
5. It is possible because of weak validation  in `Locker.isListing` on Line 435 below. The validation is done in order to stp redeem/swapping the tokens that are inside the listing (liquid/dutch/protected). It checks by calling `listings(_collection, _tokenId).owner` whether 0 address or some user, but on Line 299 in `ProtectedListings.unlockProtectedListing` below, the owner is cleared.
6. So technically anyone can redeem/swap this BAYC 25. the isListing check should also check whether the state of `canWithdrawAsset[_collection][_tokenId]` is also a 0 address or not. Allow to swap/redeem only if the `canWithdrawAsset` state is 0 address.

## Impact
The protected listing unlocker who unlocked with `bool _withdraw = false`, his NFT can be swapped/redeemed by anyone and he cannot redeem his token ever again. Loss of funds to user, so high severity
