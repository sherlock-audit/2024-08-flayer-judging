# ProtectedListings::unlockProtectedListing() burns fees meant to be given to protocol

### Summary

Fees that are meant to accrue to the protocol upon usage of ProtectedListings::unlockProtectedListing() are burnt, denying the protocol fee revenue and breaking the 1:1 ratio of NFTs to fTokens.

### Root Cause

In unlockProtectedListing() there are a few [lines that burn tokens.](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L303-L308) The intention was to burn the fToken representing the NFT that the user is withdrawing from the protocol, but the fees charged by the protocol are burnt as well.

```solidity
        // Repay the loaned amount, plus a fee from lock duration
            // @audit unlockPrice() returns tokenTaken + fees
@>      uint fee = unlockPrice(_collection, _tokenId) * 10 ** denomination;
        collectionToken.burnFrom(msg.sender, fee);

        // We need to burn the amount that was paid into the Listings contract
        collectionToken.burn((1 ether - tokenTaken) * 10 ** denomination);
```

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The protocol will lose all fees that a listing accrued if the owner uses this function. Additionally, there will no longer be a 1:1 relationship between fTokens and NFTs.

### PoC

Please copy and paste the following into ProtectedListings.t.sol:
```solidity
function test_BurnedFeesOnUnlockProtectedListing() public {
        // Set the owner to one of our test users (Alice)
        address payable _owner = users[0];

        // Mint our token to the _owner
        erc721a.mint(_owner, 1);
        erc721a.mint(_owner, 2);

        // Create our listing
        vm.startPrank(_owner);
        erc721a.approve(address(protectedListings), 1);
        _createProtectedListing({
            _listing: IProtectedListings.CreateListing({
                collection: address(erc721a),
                tokenIds: _tokenIdToArray(1),
                listing: IProtectedListings.ProtectedListing({
                    owner: _owner,
                    tokenTaken: 0.5e18,
                    checkpoint: 0
                })
            })
        });

        // Create another listing just to ensure the user has enough balance to pay for the unlock of the first one
        erc721a.approve(address(protectedListings), 2);
        _createProtectedListing({
            _listing: IProtectedListings.CreateListing({
                collection: address(erc721a),
                tokenIds: _tokenIdToArray(2),
                listing: IProtectedListings.ProtectedListing({
                    owner: _owner,
                    tokenTaken: 0.5e18,
                    checkpoint: 0
                })
            })
        });

        // check the total supply - should be 12 tokens
        uint256 supply = locker.collectionToken(address(erc721a)).totalSupply();
        assert(supply == 12e18);

        
        // let's do the time warp again to rack up some fees on the listing
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 100 days);

        // approve the erc20 for the contract and unlock the first listing
        locker.collectionToken(address(erc721a)).approve(address(protectedListings), 2e18);
        protectedListings.unlockProtectedListing(address(erc721a), 1, true);

        // supply is less than 11e18!
        // there is no longer a 1:1 backing between nfts and ftokens - burnt tokens that were meant to be reminted never were
        uint256 supplyAfter = locker.collectionToken(address(erc721a)).totalSupply();
        assert(supplyAfter == 10955616438359360000);
    }
```

### Mitigation

Rather than burn the fee returned by unlockPrice(), burn the tokenTaken and send (unlockPrice() - tokenTaken) to the fee recipient.
