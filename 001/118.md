# EdgeCase in `CollectionShutdown` leading to funds being stuck.

### Summary

EdgeCase in `CollectoinShutdown` make users funds stuck this happens when

1. shutdown started.
2. A user voted.
3. `quorumVotes` pass and wait for execution.
4. Execution revert due to active listing for the collection.
5. User can't call `reclaimVote` to get back tokens because `canExecute` is true.
6. `cancel` can't be called due to not passing the `MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS`
7. if Malicious User has listed his token for 7 days this will cause DOS of funds availability of users on weekly basis repeating that behavior

### Root Cause

- in `CollectionShutdown::start` should have a check for listing to prevent such EdgeCase.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A userA calls `CollectionShutdown::start` to start a shutdown.
2. A userB calls `CollectionShutdown::Vote` reaching those conditions :
    - `shutdownVotes` pass `quorumVotes`.
    - `canExecute` = true.
3. A Collection has listing.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A user A calls `CollectionShutdown::start` to start a shutdown.  
    [CollectionShutdown.sol#L135-L136](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L135-L136)
2. A user B calls `CollectionShutdown::Vote` reaching those conditions :
    - `shutdownVotes` pass `quorumVotes`.
    - `canExecute` = true.

[CollectionShutdown.sol#L208-L209](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L208-L210)

```solidity
File: CollectionShutdown.sol
191:     function _vote(address _collection, CollectionShutdownParams memory params) internal returns (CollectionShutdownParams memory) {
//// code
208:         if (!params.canExecute && params.shutdownVotes >= params.quorumVotes) {
209:@>           params.canExecute = true;
```

After canExecute is true I should call execute function but  
3. `execute` function revert due to collection has listing.

[CollectionShutdown.sol#L240-L242](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L240-L242)

```solidity
File: CollectionShutdown.sol
231:     function execute(address _collection, uint[] calldata _tokenIds) public onlyOwner whenNotPaused {
////code
240:         // Check that no listings currently exist
241:@>       if (_hasListings(_collection)) revert ListingsExist();
```

4. can't call `cancel` to cancel the execution due to not passing `MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS`.

[CollectionShutdown.sol#L398-L399](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L398-L399)

```solidity
File: CollectionShutdown.sol
390:     function cancel(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
////code
398:         if (params.collectionToken.totalSupply() <= MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS * 10 ** locker.collectionToken(_collection).denomination()) {
399:@>           revert InsufficientTotalSupplyToCancel();
```

5. can't call `reclaimVote` due to `canExecute`= true.  
    [CollectionShutdown.sol#L360-L361](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L360-L361)

```solidity
File: CollectionShutdown.sol
356:     function reclaimVote(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
////code
360:@>       if (params.canExecute) revert ShutdownQuorumHasPassed();
```

6. can't claim due to not executing the shutdown.  
    [CollectionShutdown.sol#L292-L293](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L292-L293)

```solidity
File: CollectionShutdown.sol
285:     function claim(address _collection, address payable _claimant) public nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
////code
292:         if (params.sweeperPool == address(0)) revert ShutdownNotExecuted();
```

7. The tokens of user A and user B are stuck in the contract.

There is no other way for users to get their tokens or an equivalent value, as long as the attacker keeps listing his tokens on unfavorable price on weekly basis `duration`

### Impact

Loss of funds

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

- add a check for listing in `CollectionShutdown::start` so that we don't shutdown start with listings
- add check in Listings contract to prevent prolonging a listing or create new listing when that collection `canExecute = true`
