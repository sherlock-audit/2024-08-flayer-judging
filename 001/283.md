# Due to incorrect implementation of the `reserve` function, users may lose NFT and funds.

### Summary

The user calls [`reserve()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L692) of `Listings.sol` to handle the reservation of a listed NFT. But in this function mapping variable `_listings[_collection][_tokenId]` is not deleted. As a result, the user may lose NFT and funds.

### Root Cause

Mapping variable `_listings[_collection][_tokenId]` is not deleted.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

User calls `reserve()` in `Listings.sol`.

### Attack Path

Alice calls `reserve()` to reserve listed NFT whose owner is Bob. At that time, Alice paid some funds to the contract and then still remained in `Locker.sol`. Next, Bob calls `cancelListings` function to withdraw NFT from `Locker.sol`.

### Impact

A malicious user may steal NFT.

### PoC

The user calls `reserve()` of `Listings.sol` to handle the reservation of a listed NFT.
```solidity
    function reserve(address _collection, uint _tokenId, uint _collateral) public nonReentrant lockerNotPaused {
        // Read the existing listing in a single read
        Listing memory oldListing = _listings[_collection][_tokenId];

        // Ensure the caller is not the owner of the listing
        if (oldListing.owner == msg.sender) revert CallerIsAlreadyOwner();

        // Ensure that the existing listing is available
        (bool isAvailable, uint listingPrice) = getListingPrice(_collection, _tokenId);
        if (!isAvailable) revert ListingNotAvailable();

        // Find the underlying {CollectionToken} attached to our collection
        ICollectionToken collectionToken = locker.collectionToken(_collection);

        // Check if the listing is a floor item and process additional logic if there
        // was an owner (meaning it was not floor, so liquid or dutch).
        if (oldListing.owner != address(0)) {
            // We can process a tax refund for the existing listing if it isn't a liquidation
            if (!_isLiquidation[_collection][_tokenId]) {
                (uint _fees,) = _resolveListingTax(oldListing, _collection, true);
                if (_fees != 0) {
                    emit ListingFeeCaptured(_collection, _tokenId, _fees);
                }
            }

            // If the floor multiple of the original listings is different, then this needs
            // to be paid to the original owner of the listing.
            uint listingFloorPrice = 1 ether * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination();
            if (listingPrice > listingFloorPrice) {
                unchecked {
                    collectionToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, oldListing.owner, listingPrice - listingFloorPrice);
                }
            }

            // Reduce the amount of listings
            unchecked { listingCount[_collection] -= 1; }
        }

        // Burn the tokens that the user provided as collateral, as we will have it minted
        // from {ProtectedListings}.
        collectionToken.burnFrom(msg.sender, _collateral * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination());

        // We can now pull in the tokens from the Locker
        locker.withdrawToken(_collection, _tokenId, address(this));
        IERC721(_collection).approve(address(protectedListings), _tokenId);

        // Create a protected listing, taking only the tokens
        uint[] memory tokenIds = new uint[](1);
        tokenIds[0] = _tokenId;
        IProtectedListings.CreateListing[] memory createProtectedListing = new IProtectedListings.CreateListing[](1);
        createProtectedListing[0] = IProtectedListings.CreateListing({
            collection: _collection,
            tokenIds: tokenIds,
            listing: IProtectedListings.ProtectedListing({
                owner: payable(address(this)),
                tokenTaken: uint96(1 ether - _collateral),
                checkpoint: 0 // Set in the `createListings` call
            })
        });

        // Create our listing, receiving the ERC20 into this contract
        protectedListings.createListings(createProtectedListing);

        // We should now have received the non-collateral assets, which we will burn in
        // addition to the amount that the user sent us.
        collectionToken.burn((1 ether - _collateral) * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination());

        // We can now transfer ownership of the listing to the user reserving it
        protectedListings.transferOwnership(_collection, _tokenId, payable(msg.sender));
    }
```
As you can see, mapping variable `_listings[_collection][_tokenId]` is not deleted. So original owner can call `cancelListings` to withdraw NFT from `Locker.sol`.
```solidity
    function cancelListings(address _collection, uint[] memory _tokenIds, bool _payTaxWithEscrow) public lockerNotPaused {
        uint fees;
        uint refund;

        for (uint i; i < _tokenIds.length; ++i) {
            uint _tokenId = _tokenIds[i];

            // Read the listing in a single read
            Listing memory listing = _listings[_collection][_tokenId];

            // Ensure the caller is the owner of the listing
            if (listing.owner != msg.sender) revert CallerIsNotOwner(listing.owner);

            // We cannot allow a dutch listing to be cancelled. This will also check that a liquid listing has not
            // expired, as it will instantly change to a dutch listing type.
            Enums.ListingType listingType = getListingType(listing);
            if (listingType != Enums.ListingType.LIQUID) revert CannotCancelListingType();

            // Find the amount of prepaid tax from current timestamp to prepaid timestamp
            // and refund unused gas to the user.
            (uint _fees, uint _refund) = _resolveListingTax(listing, _collection, false);
            emit ListingFeeCaptured(_collection, _tokenId, _fees);

            fees += _fees;
            refund += _refund;

            // Delete the listing objects
            delete _listings[_collection][_tokenId];

            // Transfer the listing ERC721 back to the user
            locker.withdrawToken(_collection, _tokenId, msg.sender);
        }

        // cache
        ICollectionToken collectionToken = locker.collectionToken(_collection);

        // Burn the ERC20 token that would have been given to the user when it was initially created
        uint requiredAmount = ((1 ether * _tokenIds.length) * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination()) - refund;
        payTaxWithEscrow(address(collectionToken), requiredAmount, _payTaxWithEscrow);
        collectionToken.burn(requiredAmount + refund);

        // Give some partial fees to the LP
        if (fees != 0) {
            collectionToken.approve(address(locker.implementation()), fees);
            locker.implementation().depositFees(_collection, 0, fees);
        }

        // Remove our listing type
        unchecked {
            listingCount[_collection] -= _tokenIds.length;
        }

        // Create our checkpoint as utilisation rates will change
        protectedListings.createCheckpoint(_collection);

        emit ListingsCancelled(_collection, _tokenIds);
    }
```

### Mitigation

Pls add `delete _listings[_collection][_tokenId];` to `cancelListings` function.
