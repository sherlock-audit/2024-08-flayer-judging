# Anyone can DOS `CollectionShutdown::preventShutdown()`

### Summary

The `CollectionShutdown::preventShutdown(...)` function can be called by a locker Manager to prevent shutdown of a particular collection, however anyone can DOS the function preventing manager from performing this action on a collection

### Root Cause

The `preventShutdown(...)` function ensure that a shutdown is not in process by checking the amount of `_collectionParams[_collection].shutdownVotes` is zero before it can proceed to prevent a colection from being shutdown.

```solidity
File: CollectionShutdown.sol
415:     function preventShutdown(address _collection, bool _prevent) public { 
416:         // Make sure our user is a locker manager 
417:         if (!locker.lockerManager().isManager(msg.sender)) revert ILocker.CallerIsNotManager();
418: 
419:         // Make sure that there isn't currently a shutdown in progress
420:  @>     if (_collectionParams[_collection].shutdownVotes != 0) revert ShutdownProcessAlreadyStarted(); // @audit When the user calls start this is busted
421: 
422:         // Update the shutdown to be prevented
423:         shutdownPrevented[_collection] = _prevent;
424:         emit CollectionShutdownPrevention(_collection, _prevent);
425:     }
```

However, anyone can call [`CollectionShutdown::start(...)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L156) for a particular the moment the acquire the collection token and the they notice shutdown has not been prevented for the collection. When this happens  `start(...)` calls [`_vote(...)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L191-L201) and the `shutdownVotes` for the collection is incremented by the users current collection token balance as shown below.

```solidity
File: CollectionShutdown.sol
135:     function start(address _collection) public whenNotPaused { // @audit does not check that the sweeper pool is created
136:         // Confirm that this collection is not prevented from being shutdown
137:         if (shutdownPrevented[_collection]) revert ShutdownPrevented();
SNIP       ......
154: 
155:         // Cast our vote from the user
156:  @>     _collectionParams[_collection] = _vote(_collection, params);
157:     }



191:     function _vote(address _collection, CollectionShutdownParams memory params) internal returns (CollectionShutdownParams memory) {

SNIP          .....

198: 
199:         // Register the amount of votes sent as a whole, and store them against the user
200:  @>     params.shutdownVotes += uint96(userVotes); 
..........
211:         }
212: 
213:         return params;
214:     }

```

This is possible even if the user has 1 wei of the collection token to vote with. Hence the choice not to prevent shutdown at the ponint the collection created is problem

### Internal pre-conditions

Collection  shutdown is not prevented when the collection is created in `Locker::createCollection(...)`

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- Alice creates a listing and receives the collection token
- Cheaper Path
    - sends 1 wei of the  collection token to Bob or a different addres
    - Bob calls `start()` with 1 wei
- More expensive path
    - Alice calls `start()` by herself with all her tokens
- Locker manager calls `preventShutdown(...)` but the function reverts because shutdown has started

### Impact

Locker manager cannot prevent shutdown for collections

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider preventing shutdown at the point of deploying the the collection token
