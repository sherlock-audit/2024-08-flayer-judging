# Protected listers can take more tokens than `MAX_PROTECTED_TOKEN_AMOUNT`

## Summary
**Impact**: Loss of funds. The user can take more tokens than the 0.95 ether limit by adjusting the listing after creation. And other users cannot unlock becasue when burning the (1 ether - token taken of theirs), it will revert because those tokens are taken by this adjusting user.
**Likelihood**: always
**Fix** : just check if the total token taken is < 0.95 ether. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Issue flow : 
1. User lists BAYC 200 as protected and token taken is 0.8 ether.
2. after 10 days, the unlock price becomes 0.9 ether (11% tax for 10 days), so 0.1 ether tax is incurred.
3. Now user calls `adjustPosition` with -0.5 ether as `_amount` parameter.
4. Since the `debt`= 0.95 - 0.9(unlock price) = 0.05 ether, the line 401 inside the else block will pass (amount > debt) = -0.5 amount is not > +0.05 debt.
5. On line 413, the token taken is increased from 0.8 to 1.3 ( 0.8 + 0.5) by transferring 0.5 ether of tokens to user on line 413.

395:         // Otherwise, the user is increasing their debt to take more token
396:         else {
397:             // Ensure that the user is not claiming more than the remaining collateral 
401:    >>>      if (_amount > debt) revert InsufficientCollateral();
402: 
403:             // Release the token to the caller
404:             collectionToken.transfer(
405:                 msg.sender,
406:                 absAmount * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination()
407:             );
408: 
409:             // Update the struct to reflect the new tokenTaken, protecting from overflow
413:    >>>      _protectedListings[_collection][_tokenId].tokenTaken += uint96(absAmount);
414:         }
417:     }

```


## Impact
Impacts : 
1. Looting the collection tokens from the contract
2. Token taken can be breached to more than 0.95 ether. In these cases, some nfts that cannot even be listed at 120 multipliers (1.2 ether) can get instant liquidity of 1.5 ether worth tokens by create + adjust the listing
3. Since more than 0.95 ether is taken, those tokens should come from the contract and not freshly minsted, those tokens are minted when creating the listing (1 ether - token taken). These amounts are high when there are multiple listings for the same collection.
