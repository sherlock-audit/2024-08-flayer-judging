# Possible overflow in `quorumVotes` while starting a shutdown in CollectionShutdown.sol

## Summary
Possible overflow in `quorumVotes` while starting a shutdown in CollectionShutdown.sol

## Vulnerability Detail
User can start a collection shutdown using `start()`, which calculates the `quorumVotes` based on the `totalSupply` of the collectionToken.
```solidity
function start(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
...
@>      uint totalSupply = params.collectionToken.totalSupply();
        if (totalSupply > MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS * 10 ** params.collectionToken.denomination()) revert TooManyItems();

        // Set our quorum vote requirement
@>      params.quorumVotes = uint88(totalSupply * SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT / ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT);
...
    }
```
The problem is, totalSupply is uint256 but quorumVotes is uint88. While calculating quorumVotes, it unsafe downcast the uint256 to uint88, resulting in overflow.

Let's see how this works
1. Suppose a collection is created with `denomination = 9`, therefore 1 collectionToken is equals `1e27`
2. `4 NFT` of that collection are deposited to Locker.sol, which mints 4 collectionToken ie `4e27(totalSupply)`
3. User wanted to shutdown the collection, which calculates the `quorumVotes ie (4e27 * 50) / 100 = 2e27`
```solidity
params.quorumVotes = uint88(totalSupply * SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT / ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT);
```
4. But the problem is uint88 can only handle ~0.3e27. As result, quorumVotes will silently `overflow`

Note: Same issue is present in `execute()`
```solidity
 function execute(address _collection, uint[] calldata _tokenIds) public onlyOwner whenNotPaused {
...
        // Refresh total supply here to ensure that any assets that were added during
        // the shutdown process can also claim their share.
@>      uint newQuorum = params.collectionToken.totalSupply() * SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT / ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT;
        if (params.quorumVotes != newQuorum) {
@>          params.quorumVotes = uint88(newQuorum);
        }
...
    }
```

## Impact
Wrong `quorumVotes` will be stored. As result, collection will be shutdown with much `less` votes than required

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use OpenZeppelin's `SafeCast` library to convert `uint256` to `uint88`
