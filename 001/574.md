# When relisting a floor item listing, listingCount is not increased, causing listingCount can be underflowed.

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L625-L672
The `relist` function is used to refill the parameters of any token listings, including floor item listing. For a loor item listing, users can change its owner from address(0) to their own address without paying any fees, and set its type to DUTCH or LIQUID. However, this operation does not change `listingCount`. So, when all the listing is filled, the `listingCount` will be underflowed to a large num(close to uint256.max) instead of 0.  Later, in the function `CollectionShutdown.sol#execute`, it will be reverted as `listings.listingCount(_collection) != 0`.

### Root Cause

In `Listings.sol#relist`, when relist for a floor item listing, listingCount is not incresed, causing listingCount can be underflowed.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The `_collection` is initialized.
2. There are floor item listings in the `_collection`.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The attacker call `relist` for a floor item listing.
2. The attacker immediately calls cancelListings to cancel it, in order to refund the tax. At the same time, listingCount is decreased. As a result, the listingCount cannot correctly reflect the number of listings contained in _collection.

### Impact

listingCount cannot correctly reflect the number of listings contained in _collection.
`CollectionShutdown.sol#execute` will be DOSed.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Avoid relisting floor item listings 
OR
Increase listingCount by one.
