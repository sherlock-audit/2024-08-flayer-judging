# Malicious user can prevent `lockerManager` from executing `CollectionShutdown` function

### Summary

Malicious user front run `CollectionShutdown::preventShutdown` by calling `CollectionShutdown::start` preventing preventShutdown execution.

### Root Cause

In-order to execute `preventShutdown` function checks that there isn't currently a shutdown in progress  
[CollectionShutdown.sol#L420](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L420)

```solidity
File: CollectionShutdown.sol
415:     function preventShutdown(address _collection, bool _prevent) public {
416:         // Make sure our user is a locker manager
417:         if (!locker.lockerManager().isManager(msg.sender)) revert ILocker.CallerIsNotManager();
418: 
419:         // Make sure that there isn't currently a shutdown in progress
420:@>       if (_collectionParams[_collection].shutdownVotes != 0) revert ShutdownProcessAlreadyStarted();
421: 
422:         // Update the shutdown to be prevented
423:         shutdownPrevented[_collection] = _prevent;
424:         emit CollectionShutdownPrevention(_collection, _prevent);
425:     }

```

The idea to prevent this is to frontrun the `preventShutdowd` to change the condition and revert.

The `_collectionParams[_collection].shutdownVotes` is changed in `_vote` function that is called in `start` function

[CollectionShutdown.sol#L156](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L156)

```solidity
File: CollectionShutdown.sol
135:     function start(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
//snip
155:         // Cast our vote from the user
156:@>       _collectionParams[_collection] = _vote(_collection, params);
157:     }
158: 
```

Going to `_vote`  
[CollectionShutdown.sol#L200](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L200)

```solidity
File: CollectionShutdown.sol
191:     function _vote(address _collection, CollectionShutdownParams memory params) internal returns (CollectionShutdownParams memory) {
//snip
200:@>       params.shutdownVotes += uint96(userVotes);
201: 
```

The choice to check if Shutdown has started is a mistake there should be implementation for reverting shutdown if its started.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `lockerManager` calling `CollectionShutdown::preventShutdown`.

### Attack Path

- Malicious user is Watching the mempool waiting for `lockerManager` to call `CollectionShutdown::preventShutdown`.
- `lockerManager` call `CollectionShutdown::preventShutdown`.
- Malicious user front run the `CollectionShutdown::preventShutdown` by calling `CollectionShutdown::start` (can be 1 wei vote making the attack more feasible)
- `lockerManager` execution would revert.

Knowing this is a time sensitive function DOS due to the fact that this function will be used by the `lockerManager` to prevent shutdown of important NFT collection.

### Impact

DOS preventing `preventShutdown` function from getting executed.

### Mitigation

Consider Calling that function via a private meme Pool

Consider preventing minimum vote amount so that the attack becomes less feasible
