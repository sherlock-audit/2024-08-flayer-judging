# After increasing the token taken, tax/debt accounting might put the listing to liquidation eventhough it shouldn't


## Summary
Impact: on adjust listing, tax is issued on updated token taken amount for the time period since listing creation instead of applying the tax for only previous token taken amount. And updated token tax should only incur tax from now on instead of incurring from listing creation. 
This might put the listing to liquidation, depending on the amount of token taken increased and also the time period between listing creation and then adjustment.

Likelihood: above medium.


## Vulnerability Detail

Issue flow : 
1. User lists BAYC 200 as protected and token taken is 0.5 ether.
2. after 10 days, the unlock price becomes 0.55 ether (10% tax for 10 days), so 0.05 ether tax is incurred.
3. Now user calls `adjustPosition` with -0.4 ether as `_amount` parameter to increase token taken from 0.5 to 0.9 ether
4. Since the `debt`= 0.95 - 0.55(unlock price) = 0.40 ether, the line 401 inside the else block will pass (amount > debt) = -0.4 amount is not > +0.40 debt.
5. On line 413, the token taken is increased from 0.5 to 0.9 ( 0.5 + 0.4) by transferring 0.4 ether of tokens to user on line 413.

Now the issue is, after the adjust listing transaction, if you call `getProtectedListingHealth` it will return 0.95 - 0.99 = - 0.04 ether. Its now liquidatable. This is due to the fact, 10% tax for the 10 days is applied to the whole new token taken amount (0.9 ether) instead of the 0.5 ether amount that user borrowed for 10 days.

So, the correct way, is to charge that tax for previous token taken (for only 0..5 ether) and not charge the tax for 0.9 ether for the new 0.9 ether. The issue will impact high if the number of days between listing creation and listing adjustment is high and also depends on the amount of token taken increased compared to previous token taken.

Fix this by collecting the tax before the token taken increases so that the new token tax will not incur the tax for the whole period but only incur it from now on.
