# Voters may lose their voting rewards in CollectionShutdown

## Summary
Voters may not claim their rewards if some users deposits into locker after we execute the shutdown flow.

## Vulnerability Detail
When we execute the shutdown flow, we will lock the `quorumVotes`. Voters' claim amount will be calculated via `params.availableClaim * claimableVotes / (params.quorumVotes * ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT / SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT)`.
The problem is that users can deposit ERC721 tokens in locker to get some collection tokens. They also can participate the claim via `voteAndClaim`. This will cause that the all claimableVotes may be larger than `params.quorumVotes * ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT / SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT`. Some voters may not claim their rewards if there is not enough balance in the contract. 
For example:
1. Collection total supply is 2 e18.
2. Alice's balance is 2 e18. And Alice votes for the shut down flow. 
3. The shutdown flow is executed and quorumVotes is 1 e18.
4. NFTs are sold in sudo swap.
5. Bob deposits 2 NFT into locker to get 2 e18 collection token and claim this shutdown rewards via `voteAndClaim`.
6. Alice cannot claim her rewards because there is not enough balance to finish this claim.
```solidity
    function execute(address _collection, uint[] calldata _tokenIds) public onlyOwner whenNotPaused {
        ...
        uint newQuorum = params.collectionToken.totalSupply() * SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT / ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT;
        if (params.quorumVotes != newQuorum) {
            params.quorumVotes = uint88(newQuorum);
        }
        ...
    }
    function claim(address _collection, address payable _claimant) public nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        ...
        uint amount = params.availableClaim * claimableVotes / (params.quorumVotes * ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT / SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT);
        (bool sent,) = _claimant.call{value: amount}('');
        if (!sent) revert FailedToClaim();
    }
    function voteAndClaim(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
        ...
        uint amount = params.availableClaim * userVotes / (params.quorumVotes * ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT / SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT);
        (bool sent,) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: amount}('');
        if (!sent) revert FailedToClaim();

        emit CollectionShutdownClaim(_collection, msg.sender, userVotes, amount);
    }
```

## Recommendation
When we execute this shutdown flow, the deposit for this collection in locker should be locked.
