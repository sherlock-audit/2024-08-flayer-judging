# It's possible to cancel a shutdown after it's been executed

### Summary

The function [CollectionShutdown::cancel()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L390) can be called after a shutdown has been executed via [CollectionShutdown::execute()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L231), this should not be possible as outlined by the comment above the function:

> If a shutdown flow has not been triggered and the total supply of the token has risen above the threshold, then this function can be called to remove the process and prevent execution.

### Root Cause

The function [CollectionShutdown::cancel()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L390) can only be executed when `params.canExecute` is set to `true`:

```solidity
if (!params.canExecute) revert ShutdownNotReachedQuorum();
```

The function [CollectionShutdown::execute()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L231) sets `params.canExecute` is set to `false` at the end of its execution, which should prevent any call to [CollectionShutdown::cancel()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L390). This can be bypassed by calling [CollectionShutdown::vote()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L175) and voting with `1` wei in order to set `params.canExecute` to `true`:
```solidity
if (!params.canExecute && params.shutdownVotes >= params.quorumVotes) {
      params.canExecute = true;
      emit CollectionShutdownQuorumReached(_collection);
}
```

### Attack Path

1. [execute()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L231) has been called, `params.canExecute` is set to `false`
2. [vote()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L175) is called, `params.canExecute` is set to `true`
3. [cancel()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L390) can be now called

### Impact

Calling [CollectionShutdown::cancel()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L390) after [CollectionShutdown::execute()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L231) will break the accounting of the [CollectionShutdown::claim()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L285) function, as the whole `_collectionParams[_collection]` struct is deleted.

This will prevent users from claiming the ETH proceeds from the sudoswap sale.

### Mitigation

Revert in [CollectionShutdown::cancel()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L390) if [CollectionShutdown::execute()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L231) has been called already.
