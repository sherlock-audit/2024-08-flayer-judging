# `ProtectedListings.sol` can't create more than 2 checkpoints

## Summary
Checkpoint creation mechanism during `createListings` will be inaccessible after the 2nd checkpoint is created
## Vulnerability Detail
During the first call of `createListings` the following logic is executed   

```solidity
            assembly { checkpointIndex := tload(checkpointKey) }
            if (checkpointIndex == 0) {
                checkpointIndex = _createCheckpoint(listing.collection);
                assembly { tstore(checkpointKey, checkpointIndex) }
            }
```
As this is the first call, `checkPointIndex` will be 0 and we proceed with the internal `_createCheckpoint` 
```solidity
        index_ = collectionCheckpoints[_collection].length;      // is 0 since it's first call

        if (index_ == 0) {                                       // if first call

            (, uint _utilizationRate) = utilizationRate(_collection);


            collectionCheckpoints[_collection].push(            // @note this will push the first checkpoint ever with values compoundFactor: 1e18 and timestamp: block.timestamp
                Checkpoint({
                    compoundedFactor: locker.taxCalculator().calculateCompoundedFactor({
                        _previousCompoundedFactor: 1e18,
                        _utilizationRate: _utilizationRate,
                        _timePeriod: 0
                    }),
                    timestamp: block.timestamp
                })
            );
        }
```
Since it is first invoke, `_timePeriod` is set on 0 meaning that the initial compound factor starts from 1e18 
```solidity
        compoundedFactor_ = _previousCompoundedFactor * (1e18 + (perSecondRate / 1000 * _timePeriod)) / 1e18; // returns 1e18
```
The internal execution ends here and returns `index_ = 0` which assigns it to `checkPointIndex` also as 0, stores it at the `checkPointKey` location in the assembly block   

Upon second invoke `checkPointIndex` is fetched form `checkPointKey`, again equal to 0, and the internal logic of `_createCheckPoint` is invoked once again however `index_ = collectionCheckPoints[_collection].length` will now equal 1. Afterwards the _currentcheckPoint is calculated and pushed in the array.
```solidity
        Checkpoint memory checkpoint = _currentCheckpoint(_collection);

        collectionCheckpoints[_collection].push(checkpoint);
```
After  `_createCheckpoint` finishes execution it returns `index_` which now equals 1, the same value is assigned to `checkPointIndex` and is stored at the `checkPointKey` location.  

Every subsequent call of `createlistings` will not create a checkpoint since the call to `createCheckpoint` is behind an if-statement which we can no longer pass since `checkPointIndex`= 1. No more checkpoints can be created.   

This creates a huge issue which will result in all protected listings being treated as if they were created in `checkPointIndex = 1`.   

```solidity
            assembly { checkpointIndex := tload(checkpointKey) }   // @audit checkPointIndex = 1 since it is last stored value
            if (checkpointIndex == 0) {                   // skip checkpoint creation
                checkpointIndex = _createCheckpoint(listing.collection);
                assembly { tstore(checkpointKey, checkpointIndex) }
            }


            tokensIdsLength = listing.tokenIds.length;
            tokensReceived = _mapListings(listing, tokensIdsLength, checkpointIndex) * 10 ** locker.collectionToken(listing.collection).denomination(); // @audit map listings invoked with stale checkpointIndex
```

At one point in the future all created protected listings will be instantly liquidatable as their `unlockPrice` will check the [`_currentCheckpoint`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L580-L595) against the one under index 1.

## Recommendation
Removing the entire `if (checkPointIndex == 0)` should resolve the issue
