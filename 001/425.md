# When reListing, Fees are Wrongly also Refunded For Liquidation Listings

### Summary

When relisting a listing in [Listings::reList](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L625-L672) function, the absence of a check for if the tokenId is a liquidation listing could allow wrongly refunding tax to the liquidation listing owner, when no fee/tax was ever charged on the listing.

### Root Cause

Liquidation listings are listings created when a protected listing becomes liquidated. Unlike normally created listings, these listings aren't taxed, and thus there shouldn't be any refund of fee when filling or relisting the listing.

But in the event were a liquidation listing is being relisted, the functionality currently wrongly processes a tax refund for the previous owner.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

+ Will unbalance the contract's internal accounting, since the refunded fee will be coming from other users taxes

### Mitigation

Just like in [Listings::reserve](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L708-L713) function, only resolve listing tax if the tokenId isn't a liquidation listing
