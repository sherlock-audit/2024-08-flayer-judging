# The attacker will prevent eligible users from claiming the liquidated balance

### Summary

The `CollectionShutdown` contract has vulnerabilities allowing a malicious actor to prevent eligible users from claiming the liquidated balance after liquidation by `SudoSwap`.

### Root Cause

* The [`CollectionShutdown::vote()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L175-L181) does not prevent voting after the collection shutdown is executed and/or during the claim state, allowing malicious actors to trigger `canExecute` to `TRUE` after execution.
* The [`CollectionShutdown::cancel()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L390-L405) does not use `params.collectionToken` to retrieve the `denomination()` for validating the total supply during cancellation, which opens the door to manipulations that can bypass the checks.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The collection token total supply must be within a valid limit for the shutdown condition (e.g., less than or equal to `MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS`).
2. The `denomination` of the collection token for the shutdown collection is greater than 0.

### External pre-conditions

1. The attacker holds some portion of the collection token supply for the shutdown collection.

### Attack Path

#### Pre-condition: 
1. Assume the collection token (CT) total supply is 4 CTs (`4 * 1e18 * 10 ** denom`).
2. There are 2 holders of this supply: **Lewis (2 CTs)** and **Max (2 CTs)**.

#### Attack:
1. Lewis notices that the collection can be shutdown and calls `CollectionShutdown::start()`.
    * `totalSupply` meets the condition `<= MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS`.
    * `params.quorumVotes` = 50% of totalSupply = `2 * 1e18 * 1eDenom` (2 CTs).
    * Vote for Lewis is recorded.
    * The contract transfer 2 CTs of Lewis balances, and `params.shutdownVotes += 2 CTs`.
    * Now `params.canExecute` is flagged to be `TRUE` since `params.shutdownVotes (2CTs) >= params.quorumVotes (2 CTs)`.

2. Time passes, no cancellation occurs, and the owner executes the pending shutdown.
    * The NFTs are liquidated on SudoSwap.
    * `params.quorumVotes` remains the same as there is no change in supply.
    * The collection is sunset in the `Locker`, deleting `_collectionToken[_collection]` and `collectionInitialized[_collection]`.
    * `params.canExecute` is flagged back to `FALSE`.

**After some or all NFTs are sold on SudoSwap:**

3. Max monitors the NFT sales and prepares for the attack.
4. Max splits their balance of CTs to his another wallet and remains holding a small amount to perform the attack.
5. Max, who never voted, calls `CollectionShutdown::vote()` to **flag `params.canExecute` back to `TRUE`**.
    * The contract transfer small amount of CTs of Max balances.
    * Since `params.shutdownVotes >= params.quorumVotes` (due to Lewis' shutdown), `params.canExecute` is set back to `TRUE`.

6. Max registers the target collection again, manipulating the token's `denomination` via the `Locker::createCollection()`.
    * Max specifies a `denomination` lower than the previous one (e.g., previously 4, now 0).
    
7. Max invokes `CollectionShutdown::cancel()` to remove all properties of `_collectionParams[_collection]`, including `_collectionParams[].availableClaim`.
    * The following check passes:
    ```solidity
    File: CollectionShutdown.sol
    398:         if (params.collectionToken.totalSupply() <= MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS * 10 ** locker.collectionToken(_collection).denomination()) {
    399:             revert InsufficientTotalSupplyToCancel();
    400:         }
    ```
    * Since the new denomination is 0, the check becomes:
    ```solidity
    (4 * 1e18 * 10 ** 4) <= (4 * 1e18 * 10 ** 0): FALSE
    ```
**Result**: This check passes, allowing Max to cancel and prevent Lewis from claiming their eligible ETH from SudoSwap.

### Impact

The attack allows a malicious actor to prevent legitimate token holders from claiming their eligible NFT sale proceeds from SudoSwap. This could lead to significant financial losses for affected users.

### PoC

#### Setup
* Update the [`CollectionShutdown.t::constructor()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/test/utils/CollectionShutdown.t.sol#L35) to mint CTs token with denominator more that 0
```diff
File: CollectionShutdown.t.sol
29:     constructor () forkBlock(19_425_694) {
30:         // Deploy our platform contracts
31:         _deployPlatform();
---
-35:         locker.createCollection(address(erc721b), 'Test Collection', 'TEST', 0);
+35:         locker.createCollection(address(erc721b), 'Test Collection', 'TEST', 4);
36: 
```
* Put the snippet below into the protocol test suite: `flayer/test/utils/CollectionShutdown.t.sol` 
* Run test: 
```bash
forge test --mt test_CanBlockEligibleUsersToClaim -vvv

### Mitigation

* Add validations to prevent manipulation of the CT denomination, and restrict voting during the claim state to prevent re-triggering of `params.canExecute`.
```diff
function vote(address _collection) public nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    // Ensure that we are within the shutdown window
    CollectionShutdownParams memory params = _collectionParams[_collection];
    if (params.quorumVotes == 0) revert ShutdownProccessNotStarted();
+   if (params.sweeperPool != address(0)) revert ShutdownExecuted();
    _collectionParams[_collection] = _vote(_collection, params);
}
```

* Update the usage of token denomination to use the token depens on the tracked token to inconsisten value.
```diff
function cancel(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
    // Ensure that the vote count has reached quorum
    CollectionShutdownParams memory params = _collectionParams[_collection];
    if (!params.canExecute) revert ShutdownNotReachedQuorum();

    // Check if the total supply has surpassed an amount of the initial required
    // total supply. This would indicate that a collection has grown since the
    // initial shutdown was triggered and could result in an unsuspected liquidation.
-    if (params.collectionToken.totalSupply() <= MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS * 10 ** locker.collectionToken(_collection).denomination()) {
+    if (params.collectionToken.totalSupply() <= MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS * 10 ** params.collectionToken.denomination()) {
        revert InsufficientTotalSupplyToCancel();
    }

    // Remove our execution flag
    delete _collectionParams[_collection];
    emit CollectionShutdownCancelled(_collection);
}
```
