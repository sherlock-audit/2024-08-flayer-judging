# `Listings::reserve` reduces the listing count without deleting them; can be abused to shutdown a collection

### Summary

Function [Listings::reserve](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L724-L725) reduces the `listingCount` variable, but doesn't delete the listing itself. This creates a discrepancy in the internal accounting system, and can be exploited e.g. to mistakenly shutdown a collection, by reducing the accounted listing count to zero, which in turn leads to burning all collection tokens from `Locker`. Another impact is that by reducing the `listingCount` for a collection disproportionate to the actual number of listings, any other function that tries to reduce it (e.g. `fillListings`, `cancelListings`, etc.) will revert when trying to decrement it below zero.

### Root Cause

Function [Listings::reserve](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L724-L725) reduces the `listingCount` variable, but doesn't delete the listing itself:

```solidity
// Reduce the amount of listings
unchecked { listingCount[_collection] -= 1; }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

none

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. For any collection, an attacker creates their listing with the floor price
2. The attacker calls `reserve` for their listing repeatedly from another account, thus transferring zero funds but reducing `listingCount[_collection]` to `0`.
3. Function [CollectionShutdown::_hasListings](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L494-L511) now passes, and the collection shutdown can now mistakenly be executed, though there are still listings existing.
4. [Locker::sunsetCollection](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L409-L427) is called, which burns all Locker's balance of collection tokens.

### Impact

Definite loss of funds: 
 - a collection can be sunset though it shouldn't be; all collection tokens are burnt from `Locker`.
 - any function that tries to reduce `listingCount[_collection]` (e.g. `fillListings`, `cancelListings`, etc.) will revert when trying to decrement it below zero. Users will lose funds due to the inability to perform operations with their listings, as well as due to the tax accumulating over time.

### PoC

not required according to the rules

### Mitigation

In `reserve`, not only decrement `listingCount[_collection]` but also delete the corresponding listing.
