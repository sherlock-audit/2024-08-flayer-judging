# There is no method of returning votes in case of cancellation, resulting in loss of funds

## Summary

There is no method for users who have voted to withdraw their votes (tokens) in case of voting cancellation in `collectionShutdown` because `reclaimVotes` becomes unavailable after cancellation, which leads to loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `cancel()` function, the `_collectionParams[_collection]` structure is deleted. Once this happens, the `reclaimVote` function cannot be used because it uses the `_collectionParams[_collection]` structure, which will be empty, and, as a result, this will lead to an overflow in the subtraction line:

(`params.shutdownVotes = 0`, `userVotes != 0` â†’ `reclaimVote` will revert)

The case where users who voted for the liquidation of the collection want to get their money back is the most common user behavior. However, this case was not tested in the tests, and, as shown above, does not work at all, which means the funds of those who voted will be locked.

Scenario 1:

- Users voted
- `cancel()` was called
- Users cannot retrieve their votes (tokens)

Scenario 2:

- Users voted
- `cancel()` was called
- Users cannot retrieve their votes (tokens)
- `start()` was called
- New users voted
- `ShutdownVotes` increased and now previous users can withdraw their funds, but new ones lost theirs

Scenario 3:

- All collection holders voted
- `cancel()` was called
- All user funds were lost

## Impact

Locking of user funds. This is a critical vulnerability with 100 percent probability.
