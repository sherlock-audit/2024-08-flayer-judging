# Missing validation for `MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS` in `CollectionShutdown.sol#execute()` function

### Summary

Since the validation for `MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS` is missing in the `CollectionShutdown.sol#execute()` function, even an activated Collection can be shut down.


### Root Cause

There is no validation for `MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS` in [`CollectionShutdown.sol#execute()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L231) function.


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

When `execute()` is called, there must be at least 4 ERC20 tokens in circulation.

### Attack Path

The `CollectionShutdown.sol#execute()` function does not prevent the shutdown process even if there are 4 or more tokens currently in circulation, that is, the pool is active.

### Impact

A shutdown process can be performed on an activated pool.

### PoC

`MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS` is the maximum number of tokens in active circulation for a collection that can be shutdown.
```solidity
    /// The maximum number of tokens in active circulation for a collection that
    /// can be shutdown.
    uint public constant MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS = 4 ether;
```
In the [`CollectionShutdown.sol#start()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L135) function, a check is performed for MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS to prevent the shutdown process if the pool corresponding to the collection is activated.
```solidity
    if (totalSupply > MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS * 10 ** params.collectionToken.denomination()) revert TooManyItems();
```
However, in the `CollectionShutdown.sol#execute()` function, `params.quorumVotes` is updated and the function is executed regardless of whether `totalSupply()` is greater than MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS.
```solidity
        uint newQuorum = params.collectionToken.totalSupply() * SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT / ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT;
        if (params.quorumVotes != newQuorum) {
            params.quorumVotes = uint88(newQuorum);
        }
```
Therefore, the shutdown process may proceed even while the pool is active, which may result in unexpected losses.

It also violates the restrictions of the protocol.


### Mitigation

It is recommended to modify the `CollectionShutdown.sol#execute()` function as follows:
```solidity
    function execute(address _collection, uint[] calldata _tokenIds) public onlyOwner whenNotPaused {
        // Ensure that the vote count has reached quorum
        CollectionShutdownParams storage params = _collectionParams[_collection];
        if (!params.canExecute) revert ShutdownNotReachedQuorum();

        // Ensure we have specified token IDs
        uint _tokenIdsLength = _tokenIds.length;
        if (_tokenIdsLength == 0) revert NoNFTsSupplied();

        // Check that no listings currently exist
        if (_hasListings(_collection)) revert ListingsExist();

        // Refresh total supply here to ensure that any assets that were added during
        // the shutdown process can also claim their share.
---     uint newQuorum = params.collectionToken.totalSupply() * SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT / ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT;
+++     uint totalSupply = params.collectionToken.totalSupply();
+++     if (totalSupply > MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS * 10 ** params.collectionToken.denomination()) revert TooManyItems();
+++     uint newQuorum = totalSupply * SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT / ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT;
        if (params.quorumVotes != newQuorum) {
            params.quorumVotes = uint88(newQuorum);
        }

        // Lockdown the collection to prevent any new interaction
        locker.sunsetCollection(_collection);

        // Iterate over our token IDs and transfer them to this contract
        IERC721 collection = IERC721(_collection);
        for (uint i; i < _tokenIdsLength; ++i) {
            locker.withdrawToken(_collection, _tokenIds[i], address(this));
        }

        // Approve sudoswap pair factory to use our NFTs
        collection.setApprovalForAll(address(pairFactory), true);

        // Map our collection to a newly created pair
        address pool = _createSudoswapPool(collection, _tokenIds);

        // Set the token IDs that have been sent to our sweeper pool
        params.sweeperPoolTokenIds = _tokenIds;
        sweeperPoolCollection[pool] = _collection;

        // Update our collection parameters with the pool
        params.sweeperPool = pool;

        // Prevent the collection from being executed again
        params.canExecute = false;
        emit CollectionShutdownExecuted(_collection, pool, _tokenIds);
    }
```
