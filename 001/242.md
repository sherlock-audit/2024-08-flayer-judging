# An attacker can use frontrunning to disrupt the shutdown function of a collection.

### Summary

According to the protocol flow, shutdown is not allowed for a specific collection. However, since the check for this exists only in [`start()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L135), if an attacker frontruns the execution of `preventShutdown()`, the check for this can be bypassed.


### Root Cause

There not exists check of shutdownPrevented about specified collection.

### Internal pre-conditions

params.collectionToken.totalSupply() <= MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS * 10 ** params.collectionToken.denomination()


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

It behaves differently from the intent of the protocol.

### PoC

There not exists check of shutdownPrevented about specified collection.
```solidity
    function vote(address _collection) public nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        // Ensure that we are within the shutdown window
        CollectionShutdownParams memory params = _collectionParams[_collection];
        if (params.quorumVotes == 0) revert ShutdownProccessNotStarted();

        _collectionParams[_collection] = _vote(_collection, params);
    }
    function execute(address _collection, uint[] calldata _tokenIds) public onlyOwner whenNotPaused {
        // Ensure that the vote count has reached quorum
        CollectionShutdownParams storage params = _collectionParams[_collection];
        if (!params.canExecute) revert ShutdownNotReachedQuorum();

        // Ensure we have specified token IDs
        uint _tokenIdsLength = _tokenIds.length;
        if (_tokenIdsLength == 0) revert NoNFTsSupplied();

        // Check that no listings currently exist
        if (_hasListings(_collection)) revert ListingsExist();

        // Refresh total supply here to ensure that any assets that were added during
        // the shutdown process can also claim their share.
        uint newQuorum = params.collectionToken.totalSupply() * SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT / ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT;
        if (params.quorumVotes != newQuorum) {
            params.quorumVotes = uint88(newQuorum);
        }

        // Lockdown the collection to prevent any new interaction
        locker.sunsetCollection(_collection);

        // Iterate over our token IDs and transfer them to this contract
        IERC721 collection = IERC721(_collection);
        for (uint i; i < _tokenIdsLength; ++i) {
            locker.withdrawToken(_collection, _tokenIds[i], address(this));
        }

        // Approve sudoswap pair factory to use our NFTs
        collection.setApprovalForAll(address(pairFactory), true);

        // Map our collection to a newly created pair
        address pool = _createSudoswapPool(collection, _tokenIds);

        // Set the token IDs that have been sent to our sweeper pool
        params.sweeperPoolTokenIds = _tokenIds;
        sweeperPoolCollection[pool] = _collection;

        // Update our collection parameters with the pool
        params.sweeperPool = pool;

        // Prevent the collection from being executed again
        params.canExecute = false;
        emit CollectionShutdownExecuted(_collection, pool, _tokenIds);
    }
```

### Mitigation

It is recommendation to add check of shutdownPrevented in execute() and vote().
