# Reserving a listing checkpoints the collection's `compoundFactor` at an intermediary higher compound factor

### Summary

When a listing is reserved (**Listings**#`reserve()`) there are multiple CollectionToken operations that affect its `totalSupply` that take place in the following order: transfer → transfer → burn → mint → transfer → burn. After the function ends execution the `totalSupply` of the CollectionToken itself remains unchanged compared to before the call to the function, but in the middle of its execution a protected listing is created and its compound factor is checkpointed at an intermediary state of the CollectionToken's total supply (between the first burn and the mint) that will later affect the rate of interest accrual on the loan itself in harm to all borrowers of NFTs in that collection causing them to actually accrue more interest on the loan.

### Root Cause

To be able to understand the issue, we must inspect what CollectionToken operations are performed throughout the execution of the `reserve()` function and at which point exactly the protected listing's `compoundFactor` is checkpointed.

(Will comment out the irrelevant parts of the function for brevity)
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L690-L759
```solidity
    function reserve(address _collection, uint _tokenId, uint _collateral) public nonReentrant lockerNotPaused {
        // ...
        
        if (oldListing.owner != address(0)) {
            // We can process a tax refund for the existing listing if it isn't a liquidation
            if (!_isLiquidation[_collection][_tokenId]) {
                // 1st transfer
→               (uint _fees,) = _resolveListingTax(oldListing, _collection, true);
                if (_fees != 0) {
                    emit ListingFeeCaptured(_collection, _tokenId, _fees);
                }
            }
            
            // ...
            
            if (listingPrice > listingFloorPrice) {
                unchecked {
                    // 2nd transfer
→                   collectionToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, oldListing.owner, listingPrice - listingFloorPrice);
                }
            }
            
            // ...
        }

        // 1st burn
→       collectionToken.burnFrom(msg.sender, _collateral * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination());

        // ...

        // the protected listing is recorded in storage with the just-checkpointed compoundFactor
        // then: mint + transfer
→       protectedListings.createListings(createProtectedListing);

        // 2nd burn
→       collectionToken.burn((1 ether - _collateral) * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination());

        // ...
    }
```

Due to the loan's `compoundFactor` being checkpointed before the second burn of `1 ether - _collateral` CollectionTokens (and before `listingCount[listing.collection]` is incremented) , the `totalSupply` will be temporarily decreased which will make the collection's utilization ratio go up a notch due to the way it's derived and this will eventually be reflected in the checkpointed `compoundFactor` for the current block and respectively for the loan as well.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L117-L156
```solidity
    function createListings(CreateListing[] calldata _createListings) public nonReentrant lockerNotPaused {
        // ...
        
        for (uint i; i < _createListings.length; ++i) {
            // ...
            
            if (checkpointIndex == 0) {
                // @audit Checkpoint the temporarily altered `compoundFactor` due to the temporary
                // change in the CollectionToken's `totalSupply`.
→               checkpointIndex = _createCheckpoint(listing.collection);
                assembly { tstore(checkpointKey, checkpointIndex) }
            }

            // ...
            
            // @audit Store the listing with a pointer to the index of the inacurate checkpoint above
→           tokensReceived = _mapListings(listing, tokensIdsLength, checkpointIndex) * 10 ** locker.collectionToken(listing.collection).denomination();

            // Register our listing type
            unchecked {
                listingCount[listing.collection] += tokensIdsLength;
            }

            // ...
        }
    }
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L530-L571
```solidity
    function _createCheckpoint(address _collection) internal returns (uint index_) {

        // ...
        
        collectionCheckpoints[_collection].push(checkpoint);
    }
```

`_currentCheckpoint()` will fetch the current utilization ratio which is temporarily higher and will calculate the current checkpoint's `compoundedFactor` with it (which the newly created loan will reference thereafter).

                _timePeriod: block.timestamp - previousCheckpoint.timestamp
            }),
            timestamp: block.timestamp
        });
    }

            if (totalSupply != 0) {

### Impact

Knowing how a collection's utilization rate is calculated we can clearly see the impact it'll have on the checkpointed compounded factor for a block:

$utilizationRate = \dfrac{collection\ protected\ listings\ count\ *\ 1e36\ *\ 10^{denomination}}{CT\ total\ supply}$

The less CollectionToken (CT) total supply, the higher the utilization rate for a constant collection's protected listings count. The higher the utilization rate, the higher the `compoundedFactor` will be for the current checkpoint and for the protected position created (the loan). 

$`compoundedFactor = \dfrac{previousCompoundFactor\ *\ (1e18 + (perSecondRate\ / 1000 * \_timePeriod))}{1e18}`$
Where:
$perSecondRate = \dfrac{interestRate * 1e18}{365 * 24 * 60 * 60}$

$interestRate = 200 + \dfrac{utilizationRate * 600}{0.8e18}$ – When `utilizationRate` ≤ 0.8e18 (`UTILIZATION_KINK`)
OR
$interestRate = (\dfrac{(utilizationRate - 200) * (100 - 8)}{1e18 - 200} + 8) * 100$ – When `utilizationRate` > 0.8e18 (`UTILIZATION_KINK`)

As a result (and with the help of another issue that has a different root cause and a fix which is submitted separately) the loan will end up checkpointing a temporarily higher `compoundedFactor`  and thus will compound more interest in the future than it's correct to. It's important to know that no matter how many times `createCheckpoint()` is called after the call to `reserve()`, the `compoundFactor` for the current block's checkpoint will remain as. But even without that, there is **no guarantee** that even if it worked correctly, there'd by any calls that'd record a new checkpoint for that collection.


### PoC

1. Bob lists an NFT for sale. The `duration` and the `floorMultiple` of the listing are irrelevant in this case.
2. John sees the NFT and wants to reserve it, putting up $0.9e18$ amount of CollectionTokens as `_collateral`.
3. The `_collateral` is burned.
4. The collection's `compoundFactor` for the current block is checkpointed.

Let's say there is only one protected listing prior to John's call to `reserve()` and its owner has put up $0.5e18$ CollectionTokens as collateral.

$old\ collection\ token\ total\ supply = 5e18$
$collection\ protected\ listings\ count = 1$

We can now calculate the utilization rate the way it's calculated right now:

$utilizationRate = \dfrac{collection\ protected\ listings\ count\ * 1e36 * 10^{denomination}}{CT\ total\ supply}$

$`utilizationRate = \dfrac{1*1e36*10^0}{5e18 - 0.9e18}`$ (assuming `denomination` is 0)

$utilizationRate = \dfrac{1e36}{4.1e18} = 243902439024390243$

We can now proceed to calculate the wrong compounded factor:

$`compoundedFactor = \dfrac{previousCompoundFactor\ *\ (1e18 + (perSecondRate\ / 1000 * \_timePeriod))}{1e18}`$

**Where**:
$previousCompoundFactor = 1e18$
$interestRate = 200 + \dfrac{utilizationRate * 600}{0.8e18} = 200 + \dfrac{243902439024390243 * 600}{0.8e18} = 382$ (3.82 %)

$perSecondRate = \dfrac{interestRate * 1e18}{365 * 24 * 60 * 60} = \dfrac{382 * 1e18}{31 536 000} = 12113140537798$
$timePeriod = 432000\ (5\ days)$ (last checkpoint was made 5 days ago)

$compoundedFactor = \dfrac{1e18 * (1e18 + (12113140537798 / 1000 * 432000))}{1e18}$

$compoundedFactor = \dfrac{1e18 * 1005232876711984000}{1e18} = 1005232876711984000$ (This will be the final compound factor for the checkpoint for the current block)

The correct utilization rate however, should be calculated with a current collection token total supply of $5e18$ at the time when `reserve()` is called, which will result in:
$`utilizationRate = \dfrac{collection\ protected\ listings\ count\ *\ 1e36\ *\ 10^{denomination}}{CT\ total\ supply} = \dfrac{1 * 1e36}{5e18} = 200000000000000000`$

The difference with the wrong utilization rate is $`43902439024390243`$ or ~$`0.439e18`$ which is ~18% smaller than the wrongly computed utilization rate).

From then on the interest rate will be lower and thus the final and correct compounded factor comes out at $1004794520547808000$ (will not repeat the formulas for brevity) which is around 0.05% smaller than the wrongly recorded compounded factor. The % might not be big but remember that this error will be bigger with the longer time period between the two checkpoints and will be compounding with every call to `reserve()`.

5. A protected listing is created for the reserved NFT, referencing the current checkpoint.
6. When the collection's `compoundFactor` is checkpointed the next time, the final `compoundFactor` product will be times greater due to the now incremented collection's protected listings count and the increased (back to the value before the reserve was made) total supply of CollectionTokens.

Lets say after another 5 days the `createCheckpoint()` method is called for that collection without any changes in the CollectionToken total supply or the collection's protected listings count. The math will remain mostly the same with little updates and we will first run the math with the wrongly computed $previousCompoundedFactor$ and then will compare it to the correct one.

$collection\ token\ total\ supply = 5e18$ (because the burned `_collateral` amount of CollectionTokens has been essentially minted to the **ProtectedListings** contract hence as we said `reserve()` does **not** affect the total supply after the function is executed).
$collection\ protected\ listings\ count = 2$ (now 1 more due to the created protected listing)
$previousCompoundedFactor = 1005232876711984000$ (the wrong one, as we derived it a bit earlier)
$utilizationRate = \dfrac{collection\ protected\ listings\ count\ *\ 1e36\ *\ 10^{denomination}}{CT\ total\ supply}$

$utilizationRate = \dfrac{2 * 1e36 * 10^0}{5e18} = \dfrac{2e36}{5e18} = 0.4e18$

$interestRate = 200 + \dfrac{utilizationRate * 600}{0.8e18} = 200 + \dfrac{0.4e18 * 600}{0.8e18} = 500$ (5 %)
$perSecondRate = \dfrac{interestRate * 1e18}{365 * 24 * 60 * 60} = \dfrac{500 * 1e18}{31 536 000} = 15854895991882$
$timePeriod = 432000\ (5\ days)$ (the previous checkpoint was made 5 days ago)

$compoundedFactor = \dfrac{1005232876711984000 * (1e18 + (15854895991882 / 1000 * 432000)}{1e18}$

$compoundedFactor = \dfrac{1005232876711984000 * 1006849315068112000}{1e18} = 1012118033401408964$ or 0.68% accrued interest for that collection for the past 5 days.

Now let's run the math but compounding on top of the correct compound factor:

$compoundedFactor = \dfrac{1004794520547808000 * 1006849315068112000}{1e18} = 1011676674797752473$ or 0.21% of interest should've been accrued for that collection for the past 5 days, instead of 0.68% which in this case is 3 times bigger.


### Mitigation

Just burn the `_collateral` amount after the protected listing is created. This way the `compoundedFactor` will be calculated and checkpointed properly.
