# `createCheckpoint()` is not called at the end of the listing:reserve()

## Summary
`createCheckpoint()` is not called at the end of the listing:reserve()

## Vulnerability Detail
User can reserve a listed token using `listing:reserve()`, which create a `protectedListing` for that tokenId.
```solidity
function reserve(address _collection, uint _tokenId, uint _collateral) public nonReentrant lockerNotPaused {
...
        // Create a protected listing, taking only the tokens
        uint[] memory tokenIds = new uint[](1);
        tokenIds[0] = _tokenId;
        IProtectedListings.CreateListing[] memory createProtectedListing = new IProtectedListings.CreateListing[](1);
        createProtectedListing[0] = IProtectedListings.CreateListing({
            collection: _collection,
            tokenIds: tokenIds,
            listing: IProtectedListings.ProtectedListing({
                owner: payable(address(this)),
                tokenTaken: uint96(1 ether - _collateral),
                checkpoint: 0 // Set in the `createListings` call
            })
        });

        // Create our listing, receiving the ERC20 into this contract
@>      protectedListings.createListings(createProtectedListing);

        // We should now have received the non-collateral assets, which we will burn in
        // addition to the amount that the user sent us.
@>      collectionToken.burn((1 ether - _collateral) * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination());

        // We can now transfer ownership of the listing to the user reserving it
        protectedListings.transferOwnership(_collection, _tokenId, payable(msg.sender));
    }
```
reserve() doesn't call the `createCheckpoint()` at the end of the function. Lets see why this is an issue:

It creates a protectedListing of that token in `ProtectedListing.sol`, which creates the checkPoint. But the problem is, there is collectionToken burn after the creation of protectedListing(see above code) & this token burn is not included in above created `checkPoint`.

And createCheckpoint() calculates the `utilizationRate`, which is dependent on the `totalSupply` of the collectionToken. Here we are not calling `createCheckpoint()`, means this token burn will not be included in `utilizationRate`
```solidity
    function utilizationRate(address _collection) public view virtual returns (uint listingsOfType_, uint utilizationRate_) {
...
            // If we have no totalSupply, then we have a zero percent utilization
@>          uint totalSupply = collectionToken.totalSupply();
            if (totalSupply != 0) {
@>              utilizationRate_ = (listingsOfType_ * 1e36 * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination()) / totalSupply;
            }
        }
    }
```


## Impact
checkpoint/utilizationRate will not be correctly updated

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add this line at the end of the reserve()
```diff
+    protectedListings.createCheckpoint(collection);
```
