# Users can't reclaim their votes after canceling a collection shutdown process

### Summary

When starting a shutdown process for a collection the total supply of the collection token should be below a certain threshold, users vote on that process by staking their collection tokens. If the total supply of this collection increases over that threshold before having the process executed, the process is subject to cancelation. 

When canceling a shutdown process, using the `CollectionShutdown::cancel` function, collection params of that collection are cleared:
```solidity
// Remove our execution flag
delete _collectionParams[_collection];
```

However, when users want to reclaim their tokens after canceling the process, by calling `CollectionShutdown::reclaimVote`, it'll try to subtract the user votes from `params.shutdownVotes`, which will always revert with underflow, as `params.shutdownVotes` is 0 after clearing the params.

This causes the tokens staked for voting to be stuck forever.

### Root Cause

When a shutdown is canceled in `CollectionShutdown::cancel`, `_collectionParams[_collection]` is completely cleared, and when a user tries to reclaim their vote tokens, user votes will be subtracted from `params.shutdownVotes` which doesn't exist anymore, [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L369).

### Impact

Tokens that have been used to vote on the shutdown process will be stuck forever after canceling the shutdown process.

### PoC

Add the following test in `flayer/test/utils/CollectionShutdown.t.sol`:

```solidity
function test_CantReclaimAfterCancel() public withDistributedCollection {
    // Vote on shutdown process
    collectionShutdown.vote(address(erc721b));

    // Some collection tokens are minted
    vm.prank(address(locker));
    collectionToken.mint(address(this), 1 ether);

    // Shutdown process is cancelled
    collectionShutdown.cancel(address(erc721b));

    // Can't reclaim vote, reverts with underflow error
    vm.expectRevert(stdError.arithmeticError);
    collectionShutdown.reclaimVote(address(erc721b));
}
```

### Mitigation

In `CollectionShutdown::reclaimVote`, handle the case where the user is reclaiming his vote tokens while having `params.shutdownVotes == 0`, maybe something like:
```solidity
if (params.shutdownVotes > 0) {
    // We delete the votes that the user has attributed to the collection
    params.shutdownVotes -= uint96(userVotes);
    delete shutdownVoters[_collection][msg.sender];
}

```
