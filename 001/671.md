# Users can manipulate interest rate using their protected listings

### Summary

Interest rate can be manipulated using protected listing. This can 
- cause users to pay more interest on their position 
- force positions into early liquidation


This will happen _faster_ with low liquidity collections. Also the attack is checap because the fees on such small amount (explained below) will be negligibly  small

### Root Cause

Because users can create protected listing with a specified `tokenTaken` as low as 1 wei and [tiny fees will be burnt](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L304-L305) on such amounts during unlocking

```solidity
File: ProtectedListings.sol
287:     function unlockProtectedListing(address _collection, uint _tokenId, bool _withdraw) public lockerNotPaused {
SNIP .............
302: 
303:         // Repay the loaned amount, plus a fee from lock duration
304:         uint fee = unlockPrice(_collection, _tokenId) * 10 ** denomination; // full debt
305:    @>   collectionToken.burnFrom(msg.sender, fee); // @audit 2) tiny amount will be burnt if significantly small amount is used for listing.tokenTaken
306: 
307:         // We need to burn the amount that was paid into the Listings contract @audit 4) even the amount burned is calculated wrong
308:   @>    collectionToken.burn((1 ether - tokenTaken) * 10 ** denomination);
SNIP       ........
312: 
329:     }
```


The problem is that with such low amounts and considering that [a huge amount of tokens will be burnt](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L307-L308) on repayment as shown on L308 above, the [`utilizationRate` (UR)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L271-L274) as shown below will increase because more token will be taken out of supply reducing the `collectionToken.totalSupply()`. 

For context, the amount burnt for each 1 wei protectedd listing during repayment is

```javascript
(1 ether - tokenTaken) * 10 ** denomination
= (1 ether - 1) * 10 ** denomination
999,999,999,999,999,999 * 10 ** denomination
```



```solidity
File: ProtectedListings.sol
261:     function utilizationRate(address _collection) public view virtual returns (uint listingsOfType_, uint utilizationRate_) {
262:         // Get the count of active listings of the specified listing type
263:         listingsOfType_ = listingCount[_collection];
SNIP               ..........

270:             // If we have no totalSupply, then we have a zero percent utilization
271:   @>        uint totalSupply = collectionToken.totalSupply();
272:    @>       if (totalSupply != 0) {
273:    @>           utilizationRate_ = (listingsOfType_ * 1e36 * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination()) / totalSupply; // @audit 24) create/unlock continuously to ensure totalSupply is reduced so that the UR can be inflated
274:             }
275:         }
276:     }

```
This will increase the interest rates of the Protected listings possibly forcing some users into liquidation.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

A user can 
- create a protected list listing with the `tokenTaken` =  1 wei of the collection token
- immediately repay the listing so that the amount of tokens burnt will be very large reducing the `totalSupply()` of the collection token and by extension increasing the `utilizationRate` (UR) of the token
- Repeat the two steps above continuosly and UR increases thus inflating the interest rate

### Impact

 This can 
- cause users to pay more interest on their position 
- force poistions into early liquidation
- burn all the balance of the collection token in the `ProtectedListing` contract

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider raising the amount of protected listing that can be borrowed
