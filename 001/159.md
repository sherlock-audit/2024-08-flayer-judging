# Rounding error when calculating `param.quorumVotes` in `CollectionShutdown` contract

### Summary

In the `CollectionShutdown` contract, a rounding error occurred when calculating `param.quorumVotes`, causing the last user to be unable to claim in the `CollectionShutdown.sol#claim()` function, and the corresponding ETH may be locked in the contract.


### Root Cause

Rounding Down occurs when calculating `param.quorumVotes` in the `CollectionShutdown` contract.

### Internal pre-conditions

- The `params.collectionToken.totalSupply()` is a little bigger than `param.quorumVotes * ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT / SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCEN`. 


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- In the [`CollectionShutdown.sol#start()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L150) function, `params.quorumVotes` is calculated as follows:
    ```solidity
    params.quorumVotes = uint88(totalSupply * SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT / ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT);
    ```
    That is
    > params.quorumVotes = totalSupply * 50 / 100

    In here, Rounding occurs due to various causes.
- Meanwhile, in the [`CollectionShutdown.sol#claim()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L310) function, ETH amount is calculated as follows:
    ```solidity
    uint amount = params.availableClaim * claimableVotes / (params.quorumVotes * ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT / SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT);
    ```

    In here, If the sum of claimableVotes is totalSupply, the sum of amount may exceed `params.availableClaim` due to rounding. In other words, the last user cannot claim due to insufficient balance.


### Impact

The last user will be unable to claim, and the corresponding ETH may be locked in the contract.

### PoC

```solidity
    mapping (address _collection => mapping (address _user => uint _votes)) public shutdownVoters;
    function test_CannotLastClaim() public {
        shutdownVoters[address(erc721a)][address(1)] = 1 ether;
        shutdownVoters[address(erc721a)][address(2)] = 1 ether;
        shutdownVoters[address(erc721a)][address(3)] = 1 ether + 1;
        uint quorumVotes = (shutdownVoters[address(erc721a)][address(1)] + 
                            shutdownVoters[address(erc721a)][address(2)] +
                            shutdownVoters[address(erc721a)][address(3)])
                            * 50 / 100;
        uint available = 10 ether;

        uint claimAmount  = 0;
        claimAmount = available * shutdownVoters[address(erc721a)][address(1)] / (quorumVotes * 100 / 50) +
                        available * shutdownVoters[address(erc721a)][address(2)] / (quorumVotes * 100 / 50) +
                        available * shutdownVoters[address(erc721a)][address(3)] / (quorumVotes * 100 / 50);
        assertEq(claimAmount, available);
    }
```

Result:
```solidity
Ran 1 test suite in 9.38ms (6.60ms CPU time): 0 tests passed, 1 failed, 0 skipped (1 total tests)

Failing tests:
Encountered 1 failing test in test/Listings.t.sol:ListingsTest
[FAIL. Reason: assertion failed: 10000000000000000002 != 10000000000000000000] test_CannotLastClaim() (gas: 75386)
```

As you can see, the ETH amount is exceed the `available1`.

### Mitigation

It is recommended to handle Rounding Errors appropriately to prevent loss of user funds.
