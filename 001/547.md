# The `relist` function does not check whether the listing is a liquidation listing causing users to pay taxes and refunds being paid to the listing owner who did not pay taxes

## Summary
Since liquidated listings are created without the original owner paying taxes, the lack of a check for the liquidation status means the system might incorrectly process a tax refund for a listing that was liquidated, allowing the original owner to receive funds they should not be entitled to
## Vulnerability Detail
Liquidated listings are created without the original owner paying taxes. If the system lacks a check for liquidation status, it might process a tax refund incorrectly, The absence of a liquidation status check can lead to the original owner receiving tax refunds for liquidated listings, which they are not entitled to. This creates an opportunity for the owner to receive funds improperly

The problem arises because the `relist` function does not check if the Listing being relisted was from a liquidation or not, therefore causing the "relister" to pay taxes and the contract depositing refunds to the "liquidated user" who did not pay taxes.
## Impact
Without checking liquidation status, the system may wrongly process tax refunds for liquidated listings, allowing the original owner to receive undeserved funds. This error could result in a loss of funds within the protocol.

  // If the floor multiple of the original listings is different, then this needs
  // to be paid to the original owner of the listing.
  uint listingFloorPrice = 1 ether * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination();

    unchecked {
      collectionToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, oldListing.owner, listingPrice - listingFloorPrice);
    }
  }

  // Validate our new listing
  _validateCreateListing(_listing);

  // Store our listing into our Listing mappings
  _listings[_collection][_tokenId] = listing;

  // Pay our required taxes
  payTaxWithEscrow(address(collectionToken), getListingTaxRequired(listing, _collection), _payTaxWithEscrow);

  // Emit events

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check inside the `relist` Function to prevent taxes being paid for listings that were liquidated
```diff
  // We can process a tax refund for the existing listing
+  if (!_isLiquidation[_collection][_tokenId]) {
  (uint _fees,) = _resolveListingTax(oldListing, _collection, true);
  if (_fees != 0) {
    emit ListingFeeCaptured(_collection, _tokenId, _fees);
      }
+  } else {
+      delete _isLiquidation[_collection][_tokenId];
+     }
```
