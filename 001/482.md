# User might lost possibility to withdraw ERC721 token from the `Locker` contract

## Summary

`ProtectedListing` contract has a functionality to unlock listing which was earlier created by the user. To do this, user need to call `ProtectedListing::ulockProtectedListing` function. This function has input bool parameter `_withdraw`, which gives user two possibilities:

1. `_withdraw` = true - ERC721 token will be withdraw to user immadietly,
2. `_withdraw` = false - ERC721 token will stay in `Locker` contract, with possibility to withdraw later, token will be save in the mapping `canWithdrawAsset[_collection][_tokenId] = msg.sender;` as it belongs to the user.

## Vulnerability Detail

Assume Bob want to unlock listing without ERC721 withdraw (`_withdraw` = false). Bob calls `ProtectedListing::ulockProtectedListing` function. In this function, ERC721 is removed from `_protectedListings` mapping, so this token is no more marked as listed. Now, this token might be redeem or swap by Alice with `ProtectedListing::redeem` or `ProtectedListing::swap` functions. Both this functions has check if token is listed `ProtectedListing::isListed`, however token is not listed anymore. Alice redeem ERC721 which belongs to Bob.

## Impact

Bob won't be able to wihdraw his ERC721 token or other token beacuse of the mapping `canWithdrawAsset[_collection][_tokenId] = msg.sender`. Token id assigned to his addres is no more in the `Locker` contract and also this mapping do not allow to withdraw different ERC721.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add one more check to `Locker::isListing` function.
