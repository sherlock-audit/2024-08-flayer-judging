# Inability to Support Multiple Shutdowns for the Same Collection

### Summary

An incorrect logic in `CollectionShutdown.sol` prevents users from triggering multiple shutdowns for the same collection. This happens because parameters related to a collection's shutdown status are not removed from the mapping that tracks the shutdown process, causing future shutdown attempts to fail.

### Root Cause

The issue stems from the mapping `CollectionShutdown::_collectionParams`, which stores data related to each collection's shutdown process. The shutdown process follows these steps:

1. The shutdown process begins when `CollectionShutdown::start` is called, passing the collection's address as a parameter.
2. Users vote on the shutdown by calling `CollectionShutdown::vote` until the quorum is reached.
3. Once quorum is met, the liquidation process is triggered via `CollectionShutdown::execute`.
4. Users can claim proceeds from the liquidation by calling `CollectionShutdown::claim`.

After the process is completed, the `CollectionShutdownParams` struct associated with the collection remains populated with data such as quorum votes and shutdown votes. This lingering data blocks any future shutdown attempts, as the following validation fails:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L141
```javascript
function start(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
    // Confirm that this collection is not prevented from being shutdown
    if (shutdownPrevented[_collection]) revert ShutdownPrevented();

    // Ensure that a shutdown process is not already actioned
    CollectionShutdownParams memory params = _collectionParams[_collection];
@>  if (params.shutdownVotes != 0) revert ShutdownProcessAlreadyStarted();
...
```
As a result, a shutdown can only be initiated for a collection once.

### Internal pre-conditions

The collection shutdown process has not been blocked by the manager.

### External pre-conditions

The collection shutdown process is attempted more than once.

### Attack Path

User try to initiate the shutdown process calling `CollectionShutdown::vote` in order to set the new collection token and quorum votes, however the tx reverts as there are already casted votes for the collection.

### Impact

Users inability to wind down iliquid collections.

### PoC
Adjust the last part of `CollectionShutdown.t.sol::test_CanVoteAndClaim` as follows:

<summary> See PoC </summary>

```diff
    function test_CanVoteAndClaim() public withDistributedCollection {
        // Make a vote with our test user that holds `1 ether`, which will pass quorum
        collectionShutdown.vote(address(erc721b));

        // Mint NFTs into our collection {Locker} and process the execution
        uint[] memory tokenIds = _mintTokensIntoCollection(erc721b, 3);
        collectionShutdown.execute(address(erc721b), tokenIds);

        // Mock the process of the Sudoswap pool liquidating the NFTs for ETH. This will
        // provide 0.5 ETH <-> 1 {CollectionToken}.
        _mockSudoswapLiquidation(SUDOSWAP_POOL, tokenIds, 2 ether);

        // Check the number of shutdown votes and avaialble funds to claim
        ICollectionShutdown.CollectionShutdownParams
            memory shutdownParams = collectionShutdown.collectionParams(
                address(erc721b)
            );
        assertEq(shutdownParams.shutdownVotes, 2 ether);
        assertEq(shutdownParams.availableClaim, 2 ether);

        // Get our start balances so that we can compare to closing balances from claim
        uint startBalance = payable(address(2)).balance;

        // As the claiming user has not voted, we need to call `voteAndClaim` to combine
        // the two calls. This call can only be made when the collection has already been
        // liquidated fully and is designed for users that hold tokens but did not vote.
        vm.startPrank(address(2));
        collectionToken.approve(address(collectionShutdown), type(uint).max);
        collectionShutdown.voteAndClaim(address(erc721b));
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Check that `address(2)` holds the increased ETH amount
        assertEq(payable(address(2)).balance - startBalance, 0.5 ether);

        // Test the output to show that the vote element of our call has worked. We take
        // the user's tokens but to save gas we don't make updates to the voting levels
        // as the quorum has already been reached.
        assertEq(collectionToken.balanceOf(address(2)), 0);
        assertEq(
            collectionShutdown.shutdownVoters(address(erc721b), address(2)),
            0
        );
        assertCanExecute(address(erc721b), false);

        // Our values should not have updated
        shutdownParams = collectionShutdown.collectionParams(address(erc721b));
        assertEq(shutdownParams.shutdownVotes, 2 ether);
        assertEq(shutdownParams.availableClaim, 2 ether);

+        // 2nd shutdown
+        // collection token is restored
+        locker.createCollection(
+            address(erc721b),
+            "Test Collection2",
+            "TEST2",
+            0
+        );
+        ICollectionToken collectionToken2 = locker.collectionToken(
+           address(erc721b)
+        );
+        // mint 1 token for us
+        vm.prank(address(locker));
+        collectionToken2.mint(address(this), 1 ether);
+        vm.prank(address(locker));
+        assertEq(collectionToken2.totalSupply(), 1 ether); // 1 ether < MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS
+        // we should be able to trigger start, however we can't as the previous values are still stored in the collection params
+        vm.expectRevert(
+            ICollectionShutdown.ShutdownProcessAlreadyStarted.selector
+        );
+        collectionShutdown.start(address(erc721b));
    }
```

</details>

### Mitigation

Track the shutdown status using the collection token as the key in the mapping. Since a new token is created each time a collection is restored, the parameters in the struct will automatically reset, allowing new shutdown processes to be initiated.
