# Manipulating collection token's total supply to manipulate `utilizationRate`

## Summary
You can liquidate the genuine and healthy protected listings by manipulating the utilization rate. You can also unlock your protected listing by paying minimal tax by again manipulating the utlization rate. Same with adjusting the listing to add/remove the token taken amounts, do add/remove more/less than allowed due to the listing health/unlock price manipulation that directly depends on the utilization rate. 

Root cause: allowing to mint/redeem collection tokens in a single transaction/block.
Impact: ultra-high
Likelikood: high

## Vulnerability Detail
`utilizationRate` which is used in accounting the tax and debt, fee calculation can be manipulated which in turn manipulates the protected listing health and listing's unlock price. This is possible because, the `utilizationRate` depends on the collection token's total supply which is again manipulatable by depositing multiple tokens inside the locker.
The flow will be like this, deposit token ids into locker and mint the collection token of a collection, so that total supply increases. So now utilization rate decreases if total supply increases. Now interact with PROTECTED LISTING to adjust, unlock, or liquidate. All these actions depend on the listing health, listing's unlock price which depends on the difference between the compounding factor between different timestamps. These compound factors rely on utilization rate, which is manipulatable at will.

Once protected listing actions are done, you can redeem the collection tokens that were minted and you will get back the token ids. This is pure manipulation, all done in one transaction. Attackers can even increase the utilization rate by first redeeming their collateral token that they bought with WETH from uniV4 pool, and decrease the total supply to minimum due to multiple redemption, and then interact with protected listing actions (adjust, liquidate, unlock) and then due to total supply reduction, the utilization rate is pumped to max and now you can liquidate at high debts and negative listing healths which are actually health when not manipulated. After all actions, you will deposit those token ids back and make the system back to normal. But this second strategy won't have high likelihood, because the tokens redeemable will be low because the deposited ones mostly is a listing, and you cannot redeem a listed token id.

**One of the attack flow :**
1. User creates a protected listing of BAYC 25, which has current collection total supply of 20e18 tokens (, also 10 listings count, 10 locked when pool initialization), so current utilization is 0.5e18 (50%).
2. And user listed his at 2e18 compound factor at checkpoint 500, and user takes 0.7e18 tokens when listing
3. So after 3 days, the checkpoint is 515 and compound factor is at 2.5e18 and the unlock price of the listing is 0.78e18 (0.08 ether tax) at current utilization rate
4. And again 1 day passes, and the there isn't been much activity for a day, so no checkpoint is updated. In these times, the lister can deposit some BAYC into locker and pump the collection token supply and reduce the utilization rate by 1/3 or even half, and then now unlock the listing.
5. Now the lister is supposed to pay 0.8 as repayment, but he will only pay 0.78 because the utilization rate is heavily down and the new compound factor at the current timestamp is literally close to the previous checkpoint. Hence the fee owed to repay will be 0.79 + some 0.002 depending on how well the utilization rate is dumped down.

So, this is how the fee manipulation will happen. There are other flows too, but you get it. Manipulate the utilization rate, then adjust/liquidate/unlock your /other listing to abuse the manipulated unlock price/listing healths.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Block mint/redeem within a single transaction or within 1 block. In that case, sudden deposit and redeem in 1 tx is not possible, so manipulating utilization rate is also not possible.

Do the changes in Locker.sol, by introducing a new state, that `mininumDelay = 1 minute`, so that when a deposit is made, any new deposit/redeem can be done only after a minute. Or better track in number of blocks, like `minBlocksDelay`. Most dex protocols or LRT ones have this mechanism.
