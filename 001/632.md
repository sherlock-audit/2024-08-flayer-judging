# Attacker can manipulate interest rates and force liquidations for protected listings, affecting legitimate users and protocol stability

### Summary

The utilization rate calculation based on listing count rather than borrowed amount will cause an economic vulnerability for legitimate users and the protocol as attackers will create multiple low-value protected listings to artificially inflate interest rates.

### Root Cause

The choice to calculate utilization rate based on listing count rather than total borrowed amount allows for easy manipulation of a key economic parameter.

In ProtectedListings.createListings():

```solidity
function createListings(CreateListing[] calldata _createListings) public nonReentrant lockerNotPaused {
    // ...
    for (uint i; i < _createListings.length; ++i) {
        // ...
        _validateCreateListing(listing);
        // ...
        unchecked {
            listingCount[listing.collection] += tokensIdsLength;
        }
        // ...
    }
}
```
Here, listingCount is incremented for each listing, regardless of the borrowed amount.

In ProtectedListings.utilizationRate():
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L273
```solidity
function utilizationRate(address _collection) public view virtual returns (uint listingsOfType_, uint utilizationRate_) {
    listingsOfType_ = listingCount[_collection];
    if (listingsOfType_ != 0) {
        ICollectionToken collectionToken = locker.collectionToken(_collection);
        uint totalSupply = collectionToken.totalSupply();
        if (totalSupply != 0) {
            utilizationRate_ = (listingsOfType_ * 1e36 * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination()) / totalSupply;
        }
    }
}
```
The utilization rate is calculated using listingsOfType_ (which is listingCount) instead of the total borrowed amount. Even though totalsupply will also increase due to mints, the overall utilization rate will still increase

In TaxCalculator.calculateProtectedInterest():

```solidity
function calculateProtectedInterest(uint _utilizationRate) public pure returns (uint interestRate_) {
    if (_utilizationRate <= UTILIZATION_KINK) {
        interestRate_ = 200 + (_utilizationRate * 600) / UTILIZATION_KINK;
    } else {
        interestRate_ = (((_utilizationRate - UTILIZATION_KINK) * (100 - 8)) / (1 ether - UTILIZATION_KINK) + 8) * 100;
    }
}
```
The interest rate is directly calculated from the utilization rate, which can be manipulated as shown above.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker creates multiple protected listings with minimal borrowed amounts (e.g., 1 wei each as any non-zero borrowing is allowed ).
2. Each listing increases the listingCount for the collection.
3. The increased listingCount artificially inflates the utilization rate in utilizationRate().
4. The inflated utilization rate causes calculateProtectedInterest() to return a higher interest rate.
5. The attacker can maintain this state by paying minimal interest on their small borrowed amounts.

### Impact

The legitimate users suffer from artificially high interest rates, discouraging them from using the protocol. The protocol suffers reduced activity and potential loss of trust. At the same time fees earned by protocol is low due to minimal interest earned on low amount borrowings by the attacker. Additionally, the artificially high interest rates can be exploited to force liquidations of otherwise healthy positions ahead of time, causing unexpected losses for users. The attacker gains the ability to manipulate a core economic parameter of the protocol at a very low cost.
