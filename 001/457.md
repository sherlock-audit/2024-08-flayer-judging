# All Positions Become Susceptible to Liquidation While the Locker is Paused

### Summary


In ProtectedListings, users can't adjust their positions, in the event the locker is paused, users whose positions become liquidatable while the locker is paused, become immediately prone to liquidation after the locker is unpaused.



### Root Cause


The [ProtectedListings::adjustPosition](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L366-L417) function only queries [`locker.collectionToken`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L121-L123), and this function is callable even when the locker is paused, so restricting users from performing this action as a precaution only hurts the users.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

None

### Impact


Users positions could be subject to liquidation without a remedy

### Mitigation

- Allow users to adjust their positions regardless of whether the locker contract is paused.
- Remove the modifier from `liquidateProtectedListing` to permit liquidations even when the locker is locked.
  
If we examine the functionality queried when filling a listing, such as [`locker.withdrawToken`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L353-L356), we can observe that it can still be queried even when the locker is locked. 

Consider removing the `lockerNotPaused` check from the `ProtectedListings` and `Listings` contracts, as the Locker contract is already handling these checks.
