# Users can dodge `createListing` fees

## Summary
Users can abuse a loophole to create a listing for 5% less tax than intended, hijack others' tokens at floor value and perpetually relist for free.
## Vulnerability Detail  

For the sake of simplicity, we assume that collection token denomination = 4 and floor price = 1e22  

Users who intend to create a `dutch` listing for any duration <= 4 days can do the following:  
1) Create a normal listing at min floor multiple = 101 and MIN_DUTCH_DURATION = 1 days, tax = 0.1457% (`tokensReceived` = 0.99855e22)
2) [Reserve](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L690) their own listing from a different account for tokenTaken 0.95e18, collateral 0.05e18, collateral is burnt, protected listing is at 0 health and will be liquidatable in a few moments (`remainingTokens` = 0.94855e22)
3) Liquidate their own listing through `liquidateProtectedListing`, receive KEEPER_REWARD = 0.05e22 (`remainingTokens` = 0.99855e22)
4) `createLiquidationListing` is invoked with us as owner and hardcoded values `floorMultiple` = 400 and `duration` = 4 days

User has paid 0.14% in tax for a listing that would've normally cost them 5.14% in tax.
This process can be repeated any number of times even after the `liquidationListing` expires to constantly reserve-liquidate it instead of calling `relist` and paying further tax.  

There are numerous other ways in which this loophole of reserve-liquidate can be abused:  
1) Users can create listings for free out of any expired listing at floor value, they only burn 0.05e18 collateral which is then received back as `KEEPER_REWARD`
2) Users can constantly cycle NFTs at floor value (since it is free) and make `liquidationListings`, either making profit if the token sells or making the token unpurchasable at floor since it is in the loop
3) Any user-owned expired listing can be relisted for free through this method instead of paying tax by invoking `relist` 

## Impact
Tax evasion
## Code Snippet
```solidity
        _listings.createLiquidationListing(
            IListings.CreateListing({
                collection: _collection,
                tokenIds: tokenIds,
                listing: IListings.Listing({
                    owner: listing.owner,
                    created: uint40(block.timestamp),
                    duration: 4 days,
                    floorMultiple: 400
                })
            })
        );
```
                
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Impose higher minimum collateral and lower tokenTaken (e.g 0.2e18 and 0.8e18) so the `KEEPER_REWARD` would not cover the cost of burning collateral during reservation, making this exploit unprofitable.
