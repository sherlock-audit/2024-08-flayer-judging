# `ProtectedListings::_createCheckpoint()` returns wrong checkpoint index in some cases

### Summary

[ProtectedListings::_createCheckpoint()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L566) can return a wrong checkpoint index, potentially leading to out-of-bound errors that prevents users from unlocking a protected listing in order to get ERC721s back.

### Root Cause

The internal function [ProtectedListings::_createCheckpoint()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L566) returns the wrong checkpoint index when a checkpoint has been created previously in the same block (ie. same `block.timestamp`). The returned index is used by [ProtectedListings::createListings()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L143) and when setted incorrectly it leads to [ProtectedListings::unlockPrice()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L607) always reverting because it tries to access an out-of-bound element in the checkpoints array.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A new checkpoint for a collection has to be created, this can happen via [unlockProtectedListing()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L287C14-L287C36), [liquidateProtectedListing()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L429C14-L429C39), [createListings()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L117), etc.
2. An user calls [ProtectedListings::createListings()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L143) in the same block for the same collection as `1.`

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Alice unlocks an ERC721 for a collection `X` by calling [unlockProtectedListing()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol
2. In the same block Bob creates a protected listing for one of his ERC721 for the same collection `x` via [ProtectedListings::createListings()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L143)
3. It's not possible to unlock, adjust or liquidate Bob's position

### Impact

[ProtectedListings::unlockPrice()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L607), the function that reverts in case a wrong checkpoint index is set, is used internally by:

- [unlockProtectedListing()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol)
- [liquidateProtectedListing()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L429)
- [adjustPosition()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L366)

this results in users not being able to adjust their position, unlock it or liquidated it making them unable to retrive their ERC721 asset. It can also be used to craft a protected listing that cannot be liquidated.

### Mitigation

In [ProtectedListings::_createCheckpoint()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L566) return the correct index:

```solidity
if (checkpoint.timestamp == collectionCheckpoints[_collection][index_ - 1].timestamp) {
    collectionCheckpoints[_collection][index_ - 1].compoundedFactor = checkpoint.compoundedFactor;
    return index_ - 1; //<---
}
```
