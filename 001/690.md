# Malicious users will exploit the fact that `ProtectedListings::adjustPosition()` does not take a checkpoint and reduce their debt

### Summary

[ProtectedListings::adjustPosition()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L366) changes the `listing.tokenTaken` quantity, but does not take a new checkpoint of the compound factor. This means that if their checkpoint was in the past, and they reduce their `tokenTaken`, they will also reduce a part of their debt. On the other hand, honest users that increase their `tokenTaken` will have their debt instantly increased and may be liquidated right away.

### Root Cause

In `ProtectedListings:399` and `ProtectedListings:413`, a new checkpoint of the compound factor is not taken, instantly decreasing/increasing the debt.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Users borrows via `ProtectedListings::createListings()`.
2. Users adjust their positions by calling `ProtectedListings::adjustPosition()` and either exploit this to reduce their debt or be instantly liquidated.

### Impact

Users instantly reduce their debt or users get instantly liquidated.

### PoC

```solidity
if (_amount < 0) {
    // The user should not be fully repaying the debt in this way. For this scenario,
    // the owner would instead use the `unlockProtectedListing` function.
    if (debt + int(absAmount) >= int(MAX_PROTECTED_TOKEN_AMOUNT)) revert IncorrectFunctionUse();

    // Take tokens from the caller
    collectionToken.transferFrom(
        msg.sender,
        address(this),
        absAmount * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination()
    );

    // Update the struct to reflect the new tokenTaken, protecting from overflow
    _protectedListings[_collection][_tokenId].tokenTaken -= uint96(absAmount); //@audit must update the checkpoint or the debt will accumulate on the old checkpoint
}
// Otherwise, the user is increasing their debt to take more token
else {
    // Ensure that the user is not claiming more than the remaining collateral
    if (_amount > debt) revert InsufficientCollateral();

    // Release the token to the caller
    collectionToken.transfer(
        msg.sender,
        absAmount * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination()
    );

    // Update the struct to reflect the new tokenTaken, protecting from overflow
    _protectedListings[_collection][_tokenId].tokenTaken += uint96(absAmount); //@audit must update the checkpoint or the debt will accumulate on the old checkpoint
}
```

### Mitigation

Capture the checkpoint when updating `_protectedListings[_collection][_tokenId]` and realize the new debt.
