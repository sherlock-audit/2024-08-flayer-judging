# ETH will be drained from the CollectionShutdown contract because CollectionShutdownParams.quorumVotes is not compatible with collectionTokens that have 7,8 or 9 denominations i.e. 1e27 decimals.

## Summary
The protocol supports creation of collectionTokens with 1e27 decimals but the `CollectionShutdownParams.quorumVotes` is not compatible with it because `quorumVotes` is only `uint88` which supports upto only 27 digits, i.e. `uint88 max = 309,485,009,821,345,068,724,781,055` 

## Vulnerability Detail
So when `CollectionShutDown::start` function is called to shutdown the collection;
```params.quorumVotes = uint88(totalSupply * SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT / ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT);``` can overflow and `quorumVotes` will be set to incorrect amount.
This will allow the quorum to be reached than intended and more importantly early claimers will get more eth than they should and will be rewarded with eth from other collection sales and the last users to claim will be DOSed. 

##### For example:
If the totalSupply was 4e27 i.e. 4 collectionTOkens and [start](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L135-L157) was triggered then the [`quorumVotes`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L150C8-L150C98) will be set to;
* `143089941071929587651313664`, i.e. not even 1 collectionToken, when it should have been
* `2000000000000000000000000000` i.e. 2e27 
* now since the quorum set is just 0.14 collectionToken, the `params.canExecute = true;` will be triggered faster than expected,
* and the more impactfull thing is that when users claim their eth;
```javascript
        uint amount = params.availableClaim * claimableVotes / (params.quorumVotes * ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT / SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT);
        (bool sent,) = _claimant.call{value: amount}('');
```
since `params.quorumVotes` is lesser than expected `amount` will be more than what it should be and hence the claimer will recieve more eth then he should. 

## Impact
This will allow claimers to get more eth than expected, and potentially send eth which is meant for other collections, and when the contract is out of eth, every user even from those of other collections will be DOS form claiming. 

Reporting this as high because, even though 1e27 collectionTokens are likely to be created for meme nfts, this overflow can be used to steal eth from other collections.
This also doesn't need a malicious intent, it just need one or more collections with 9 denominations to be shutdown.  

## Code Snippet
```javascript
    struct CollectionShutdownParams {
        uint96 shutdownVotes;
        address sweeperPool;
        uint88 quorumVotes;
```

```javascript
params.quorumVotes = uint88(totalSupply * SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT / ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT);
```

```javascript
        uint newQuorum = params.collectionToken.totalSupply() * SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT / ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT; 
        if (params.quorumVotes != newQuorum) {
            params.quorumVotes = uint88(newQuorum); 
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change uint88 to uint128;
```diff
    struct CollectionShutdownParams {
        uint96 shutdownVotes;
        address sweeperPool;
-       uint88 quorumVotes;
+       uint128 quorumVotes;
```
```diff
-       params.quorumVotes = uint88(totalSupply * SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT / ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT);
+       params.quorumVotes = uint128(totalSupply * SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT / ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT);

```

```diff
        uint newQuorum = params.collectionToken.totalSupply() * SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT / ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT; 
        if (params.quorumVotes != newQuorum) {
-           params.quorumVotes = uint88(newQuorum); 
+           params.quorumVotes = uint128(newQuorum); 

```


Also, this might be okay but it still supports only upto `type(uint96).max = 79,228,162,514,264,337,593,543,950,335` i.e. only upto 79 collectionTokens if in 1e27 decimals. Supporting upto 79 tokens is safe considering the `MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS` which is 4, but I suggest this to be changed too to higher uint just to be safer.
```javascript
        params.shutdownVotes += uint96(userVotes);
```
