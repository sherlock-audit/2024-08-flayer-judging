# Malicious users that reserve NFTs, can adjust their protectedPositions, and pay much less interest rate that they should

### Summary

The Flayer protocol allows users to reserve NFTs that they can't immediately buy via the [reserve()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L690-L759) function. Users that reserve should pay interest rate until they fully unlock the NFT, and provide some collateral. The protocol allows suers to modify their protected listing via the [adjustPosition()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L366-L417) function, however the interest rate that is owned up to this moment is not taken into account. A malicious user can repay part of the tokens he owes interest over, without first repaying the interest, and then when he decides to fully unlock his NFT via the [unlockProtectedListing()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L287-L329) function, he will be charged interest only on the amount that is remaining, not on the full amount that he borrowed. 


### Root Cause

In the [adjustPosition()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L366-L417) function, the user can repay part of the tokens he is accruing interest over, however the interest owned up to this moment is not taken into account.

### Attack Path
Lets consider the following scenario:
1. When the user reserves the NFT he provides **0.5e18** tokens as collateral, and now he has tokenTaken = **0.5e18** on which he accrues interest. 
2. Time passes and the user has to pay for example 8% on the **0.5e18** tokens. 
3. Instead of paying 8% interest rate on the **0.5e18** tokens, he can repay part of the tokenTaken balance via the [adjustPosition()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L366-L417) function, lets say **0.4e18**
4. Then when he decides to fully unlock his NFT via the [unlockProtectedListing()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L287-L329) function, he will be charged **8%** interest only on the **0.1e18** tokens that are left. 
5. Instead of paying **8%** of interest over **0.5e18** tokens, the user ends up paying **8%** interest over **0.1e18** tokens

### Impact

A user can pay much less interest that he is supposed to.

After following the steps in the above mentioned [gist](https://gist.github.com/AtanasDimulski/95fe424bd5c38a08b7d12cc5c3911878) add the following test to the ``AuditorTests.t.sol`` file:

```solidity
    function test_UserCanModifyHisProtectedPostionToPayLessTax() public {
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        collection1.mint(alice, 12);

        assert(amountThatBobShouldPayIfHeDirectlyUnlocks > amountThatBobPaid);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

```solidity
Logs:
  Bob's tokenTaken:  500000000000000000
  The current price that needs to be paid to unlock the NFT:  626499999985927999
  The current price that need to be paid to unlock the NFT:  125299999997185599
  Amount that bob paid if he adjusted his position before unlocking it:  525299999997185599

To run the test use: ``forge test -vvv --mt test_UserCanModifyHisProtectedPostionToPayLessTax``
