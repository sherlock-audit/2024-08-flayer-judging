# Failure to delete the listing when it is reserved

## Summary

The [`Listings::reserve()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L690-L759) function fails to delete listings after they are moved to the `ProtectedListing` contract, resulting in outdated data remaining in the `Listing` contract. 

This failure to delete listings can lead to the misuse of listing data, causing issues in functions such as `modifyListings()`, `cancelListings()`, `fillListings()` and others that interact with listings.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [`Listings::reserve()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L690-L759) function does not properly remove the listing from the `Listing` contract once the token listing is transferred to the `ProtectedListing` contract. 

As a result, the outdated listing data persists and can be inadvertently used in various functions within the `Listing` contract. This can cause incorrect behavior and inaccuracies in processing, as the reserved/protected listing should not be available for further interactions unless it is liquidated from the `ProtectedListing` contract.

## Impact

Incorrect usage of non-existent listing data leads to several issues, including incorrect tax accounting, incorrect reserve adjustments, and the misuse of outdated listing data in various critical functions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Delete the listing after it is reserved and moved to the `ProtectedListings` contract. Additionally, for the reservation of liquidation listings, the liquidation status should be reset.

```diff
function reserve(address _collection, uint _tokenId, uint _collateral) public nonReentrant lockerNotPaused {
---
    if (oldListing.owner != address(0)) {
        // We can process a tax refund for the existing listing if it isn't a liquidation
        if (!_isLiquidation[_collection][_tokenId]) {
            (uint _fees,) = _resolveListingTax(oldListing, _collection, true);
            if (_fees != 0) {
                emit ListingFeeCaptured(_collection, _tokenId, _fees);
            }
-        }
+        } else {
+           delete _isLiquidation[_collection][_tokenId];
+        }
        
        // If the floor multiple of the original listings is different, then this needs
        // to be paid to the original owner of the listing.
        uint listingFloorPrice = 1 ether * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination();
        if (listingPrice > listingFloorPrice) {
            unchecked {
                collectionToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, oldListing.owner, listingPrice - listingFloorPrice);
            }
        }

        // Reduce the amount of listings
        unchecked { listingCount[_collection] -= 1; }

+       // Delete the token listing
+        delete _listings[_collection][_tokenId];
    }
