# Casting the quorum votes to uint88 causes the value to be smaller than expected for high decimal collection tokens.

### Summary

`CollectionShutdown.sol` casts the quorum votes to uint88. If the collection token has a high number of decimals, because `denomination = 9` it will cause the quorum votes to be truncated. The attacker will be able to trigger a collection shutdown and buy the remaining NFTs for free.

### Root Cause

In [CollectionShutdown.sol:150](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L150) it casts the quorum votes to `uint88` which means that the max value is `type(uint88).max = 2 ** 88 - 1 = 3.09e+26`. If the collection token has 27 decimals (token denomination is 9) the value will overflow immediately.

That will cause the quorum votes to be a lot smaller than it should be. That in turn will cause the token to be shutdown since reaching the quorum is a lot easier now.

After the user voted, they can execute the shutdown which will create a sudoswap pool with all the remaining NFTs. The user buys all the NFTs and then claim the majority of the proceeds for themselves. That is because `quorumVotes` is such small value. Since the attacker has enough voting power to reach quorum, they will be able to claim at least 50% of the proceeds, see [CollectionShutdown.sol:310](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L310)

### Attack Path

1. attacker acquires a small amount of a given high decimal collection token, `2 * 0.263e27` to be exact so that they are able to reach quorum and claim all the proceeds from the sudoswap sales.
2. attacker initiates the shutdown of the collection token
3. attacker votes for the shutdown
4. attacker executes the shutdown
5. attacker buys up all the NFTs from the sudoswap pool
6. attacker claims the proceeds using `claim()`.

This allows the attacker to buy all the NFTs for free (minus fees).

### Impact

An attacker can steal a collection tokens NFTs.

### PoC

Here's git diff implementing a PoC where the `quorumVotes` is lower than it should be.

Instead of it being half the current total supply (`1.5e18 * tokenDenomination`) it's `262059960714619725100875776`.

         assertEq(address(collectionShutdown.pairFactory()), address(PAIR_FACTORY));

```

That shows the root cause of the issue. The remaining steps are straightforward.

### Mitigation

Don't cast votes down to a smaller number.
