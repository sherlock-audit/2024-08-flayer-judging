# The liquidation list owner may receive some tax refund

## Summary
The initial owner does not pay tax for the liquidation list. But the initial owner will get some tax refund if their liquidation list is bought via `relist()`

## Vulnerability Detail
If one protected listing is not healthy, the protected listing will be liquidated and one liquidation list will be created. There is not tax paid when we create one liquidation list. So when this liquidation list is traded, the liquidation initial owner should not earn any tax refund.
When the liquidation list is traded via `relist()`, we do not consider this kind of scenario, and pay some tax refund to the liquidation listing's owner.
```solidity
    function relist(CreateListing calldata _listing, bool _payTaxWithEscrow) public nonReentrant lockerNotPaused {
        ...
        // We can process a tax refund for the existing listing
        // @audit when we relist the liquidated list.
        (uint _fees,) = _resolveListingTax(oldListing, _collection, true);
        if (_fees != 0) {
            emit ListingFeeCaptured(_collection, _tokenId, _fees);
        }
        ...
}
```

## Impact
The liquidation list owner may receive some tax refund.
