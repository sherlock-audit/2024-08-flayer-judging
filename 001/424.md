# Type uint88 may not be suitable for storing quorum vote requirement

## Summary

Type `uint88` may not be suitable for storing quorum vote requirement.

## Vulnerability Detail

User can vote to shutdown a collection, for the shutdown to be executed, a number of votes required to reach a quorum, and the quorum is set as below:

[CollectionShutdown.sol#L147-L150](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L147-L150):
```solidity
        if (totalSupply > MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS * 10 ** params.collectionToken.denomination()) revert TooManyItems();

        // Set our quorum vote requirement
        params.quorumVotes = uint88(totalSupply * SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT / ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT);
``` 

`MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS` is $4$ ether, `SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT` is $50$ and `ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT` is $100$.

A collection token can be created with **9** denominations.

[Locker.sol#L63-L64](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L63-L64):
```solidity
    /// The maximum value of a new {CollectionToken} denomination
    uint public constant MAX_TOKEN_DENOMINATION = 9;
```

This means when the collection token's total supply is less than $4e27$ (4e18 * 10 ** 9), user can trigger a shutdown and vote, and the quorum needs to be reached is $2e27$ (4e27 * 50 / 100). 

However, `uint88` is used as the type of quorum, and its max value is $309485009821345068724781056$, roughly $0.31e27$, the value is much less than $2e27$, as a result, the quorum is truncated to $143089941071929587651313664$ and the actually required amount is much less than expected.

## Impact

Much less votes are required to reach a quorum than expected.

## Recommendation

Consider using `uint96` instead of `uint88`.

-       params.quorumVotes = uint88(totalSupply * SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT / ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT);
