# The total supply of collection tokens can change in-between starting a shutdown vote and executing it

### Summary

_No response_

### Root Cause

The function [CollectionShutdown::start()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L135) sets the quorum based on the total supply of collection tokens at the moment of execution:

```solidity
params.quorumVotes = uint88(totalSupply * SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT / ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT);
```

However, between the moment [CollectionShutdown::start()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L135) is called and the moment [CollectionShutdown::execute()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L231) is called the total supply of collection tokens can change.

This is problematic because if the total supply changes the actual quorum won't be `50%` anymore. As an example:
1. The current total supply is `4e18`, a shutdown is started via [CollectionShutdown::start()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L135) and the quorum is set to `2e18` (`50%` of `4e18`).
2. An user calls [Locker:redeem()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L209), which burns `1e18` tokens. The new total supply is `3e18`.
3. At this point `2e18` votes are required to shutdown the collection, but the total supply is `3e18`. The quorum in practice is now `2e18/3e18` =  `66%`

### Impact

If tokens are burned the quorum will be harder to reach, if tokens are minted quorum will be easier to reach.
