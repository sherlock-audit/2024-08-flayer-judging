# Overflow in CollectionShutdown vote function can prevent collection shutdown

## Summary

The `_vote` function in the `CollectionShutdown` contract is vulnerable to an integer overflow when adding user votes to the total `shutdownVotes`. This can potentially reset the vote count and prevent a collection from ever reaching the shutdown threshold.


## Vulnerability Detail

In the `_vote` function, user votes are added to the total `shutdownVotes` using:

```solidity
    function _vote(address _collection, CollectionShutdownParams memory params) internal returns (CollectionShutdownParams memory) {
        // Take tokens from the user and hold them in this escrow contract
        uint userVotes = params.collectionToken.balanceOf(msg.sender);
        if (userVotes == 0) revert UserHoldsNoTokens();

        // Pull our tokens in from the user
        params.collectionToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), userVotes);

        // Register the amount of votes sent as a whole, and store them against the user
        params.shutdownVotes += uint96(userVotes);
```

This is vulnerable to overflow because:
1. `shutdownVotes` is cast to a `uint96`.
2. There's no check to ensure the addition doesn't overflow.
3. Solidity doesn't inherently protect against overflows in this scenario.

For tokens with a high denomination (e.g., 9 decimal places), it's feasible to accumulate enough votes to cause an overflow. The maximum value of a `uint96`  can be reached with tokens that have a high total supply or denomination.

Test:
```solidity 
    function test_voteOverflow() public withDistributedCollection {
        // Make our initial vote whilst holding 1 ether of tokens
        collectionShutdown.vote(address(erc721b));

        vm.prank(address(locker));
        collectionToken.mint(address(this), 79228162514264337593543950336+1);

        // Make our additional vote
        collectionShutdown.vote(address(erc721b));

        ICollectionShutdown.CollectionShutdownParams memory shutdownParams = collectionShutdown.collectionParams(address(erc721b));
        //@audit because of the overflow, the vote will be less than expected
        assertGt(shutdownParams.shutdownVotes, 79228162514264337593543950336);
    }
```

## Impact
If an overflow occurs:
1. The `shutdownVotes` could reset to a lower value.
2. This could prevent the collection from ever reaching the quorum required for shutdown.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Higher precision type should be used to store votes.
