# Tokens are wrongly burnt from `ProtectedListing` during repayments

### Summary

Tokens are wrongly burnt during repayment of a protected listing thus depleting the the balance of the Protected Listing contract and posibly blocking repayment

### Root Cause

During repayment, the developer wrongly assumes tokens were paid in to the listing contract and thus burns tokens from the contract  as shown below on L308

```solidity
File: ProtectedListings.sol
287:     function unlockProtectedListing(address _collection, uint _tokenId, bool _withdraw) public lockerNotPaused {
288:         // Ensure this is a protected listing @audit cannot repay when Locker is paused
289:         ProtectedListing memory listing = _protectedListings[_collection][_tokenId];

SNIP     ..........

303:         // Repay the loaned amount, plus a fee from lock duration
304:         uint fee = unlockPrice(_collection, _tokenId) * 10 ** denomination;
305:         collectionToken.burnFrom(msg.sender, fee); 
306: 
307:         // We need to burn the amount that was paid into the Listings contract 
308:  @>       collectionToken.burn((1 ether - tokenTaken) * 10 ** denomination);

```

but in the actual sense, the user's repayment amount (including fees) are burnt directly from the user

The problem is that after some time the balance of the listing contract will be depleted causing the [`unlockProtectedListing(...)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L303-L308) function to revert and fail. 

In fact, an attacker can leverage this to to create listing for dust amount of `tokenTaken` and repay repeatedly knowing that L308 executing on dust amount will deplete the `protectedListing` contract faster

### Mitigation

Consider modifiying the `unlockProtectedListing(...)` function as shown below


```diff
File: ProtectedListings.sol
287:     function unlockProtectedListing(address _collection, uint _tokenId, bool _withdraw) public lockerNotPaused {
288:         // Ensure this is a protected listing @audit cannot repay when Locker is paused
289:         ProtectedListing memory listing = _protectedListings[_collection][_tokenId];

SNIP     ..........

303:         // Repay the loaned amount, plus a fee from lock duration
304:         uint fee = unlockPrice(_collection, _tokenId) * 10 ** denomination;
305:         collectionToken.burnFrom(msg.sender, fee); 
306: 
307:         // We need to burn the amount that was paid into the Listings contract 
-308:        collectionToken.burn((1 ether - tokenTaken) * 10 ** denomination);

```

Or better still transfer the user's outstanding amount including the accrued fees into the listing contract and burn the `tokenTaken` amount
