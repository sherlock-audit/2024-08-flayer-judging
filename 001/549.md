# The `reserve` Function Fails to Delete `_isLiquidation` Mapping, Causing Refund not being paid for that Token Future Listings

## Summary
The `reserve` function fails to clear the `_isLiquidation` mapping for a token ID after reservation. As a result, when the token is listed again in the future, it may be incorrectly flagged as liquidated, leading to potential issues with refund entitlements for the token owner
## Vulnerability Detail
The `reserve` function does not clear the `_isLiquidation` mapping for a token ID. As a result, when the token is listed in the future, the owner may not receive refunds they are entitled to due to the Token being marked as liquidation as `_fillListing` checks if the Token is a Liquidation or not when a buyer is about to pay taxes.

Future listing may prevent the owner from receiving the refunds they are entitled to. This occurs because `_fillListing` checks the `_isLiquidation` status to determine if taxes are applicable when a buyer is about to pay.

## Impact
As a result, the owner may not receive refunds they should be entitled to because the system mistakenly treats the token as still in liquidation status, causing a user(Owner) to have paid (the required tax amount + The amount that should have been paid by the Buyer).

```solidity

            if (_fees != 0) {

            // If the floor multiple of the original listings is different, then this needs
            // to be paid to the original owner of the listing.
            uint listingFloorPrice = 1 ether * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination();
            if (listingPrice > listingFloorPrice) {
                unchecked {
                    collectionToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, oldListing.owner, listingPrice - listingFloorPrice);
                }
            }

        // Reduce the amount of listings
        unchecked { listingCount[_collection] -= 1; }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
After the Liquidation check has confirmed the Token to be a Liquidated Token Id, delete the `_isLiquidation` mapping to regard the token as non liquidated as someone else is in Hold of it (will be if they unlock the protected listing)
```diff
if (oldListing.owner != address(0)) {
    // We can process a tax refund for the existing listing if it isn't a liquidation
    if (!_isLiquidation[_collection][_tokenId]) {
        (uint _fees,) = _resolveListingTax(oldListing, _collection, true);
            if (_fees != 0) {
                emit ListingFeeCaptured(_collection, _tokenId, _fees);
+                   } else {
+                   delete _isLiquidation[_collection][_tokenId;
+                  }
                }

            // If the floor multiple of the original listings is different, then this needs
            // to be paid to the original owner of the listing.
            uint listingFloorPrice = 1 ether * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination();
            if (listingPrice > listingFloorPrice) {
                unchecked {

                }
            }

        // Reduce the amount of listings
        unchecked { listingCount[_collection] -= 1; }
