# If the user calls `cancel()` of `CollectionShutdown.sol`, all funds corresponding to `collection` may be locked in the contract.

### Summary

The user calls [`cancel()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/tree/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L390) of `CollectionShutdown.sol` to cancel shutdown of collection. But voter can not call `reclaimVote()` so that all funds corresponding to `collection` may be locked in the contract.

### Root Cause

incorrect logic in `cancel()` of `CollectionShutdown.sol`

### Internal pre-conditions

Another users do not call `reclaimVote()`.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

User can not call `reclaimVote()` so that all funds corresponding to `collection` may be locked in the contract.

### PoC

The user calls `cancel()` of `CollectionShutdown.sol` to cancel shutdown of collection.
```solidity
    function cancel(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
        // Ensure that the vote count has reached quorum
        CollectionShutdownParams memory params = _collectionParams[_collection];
        if (!params.canExecute) revert ShutdownNotReachedQuorum();

        // Check if the total supply has surpassed an amount of the initial required
        // total supply. This would indicate that a collection has grown since the
        // initial shutdown was triggered and could result in an unsuspected liquidation.
        if (params.collectionToken.totalSupply() <= MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS * 10 ** locker.collectionToken(_collection).denomination()) {
            revert InsufficientTotalSupplyToCancel();
        }

        // Remove our execution flag
        delete _collectionParams[_collection];
        emit CollectionShutdownCancelled(_collection);
    }
```
As you can see, the mapping variable `_collectionParams[_collection]` is deleted.
Then look at why another user can not call `reclaimVote()`.
```solidity
    function reclaimVote(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
        // If the quorum has passed, then we can no longer reclaim as we are pending
        // an execution.
        CollectionShutdownParams storage params = _collectionParams[_collection];
        if (params.canExecute) revert ShutdownQuorumHasPassed();

        // Get the amount of votes that the user has cast for this collection
        uint userVotes = shutdownVoters[_collection][msg.sender];

        // If the user has not cast a vote, then we can revert early
        if (userVotes == 0) revert NoVotesPlacedYet();

        // We delete the votes that the user has attributed to the collection
        params.shutdownVotes -= uint96(userVotes);
        delete shutdownVoters[_collection][msg.sender];

        // We can now return their tokens
        params.collectionToken.transfer(msg.sender, userVotes);

        // Notify our stalkers that a vote has been reclaimed
        emit CollectionShutdownVoteReclaim(_collection, msg.sender, userVotes);
    }
```
Because mapping variable `_collectionParams[_collection]` is deleted, shutdownVoters[_collection][msg.sender] is 0. As a result, another user can not call `reclaimVote()`.


### Mitigation

Pls add modifier `onlyOwner` to `cancel()`.
