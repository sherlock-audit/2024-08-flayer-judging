# `listingCount` is not updated when floor token is directly relisted using `listing:relist()`

## Summary
`listingCount` is not updated when floor token is directly relisted using `listing:relist()`

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user list his tokens using `listing:createLinting()` then `listingCount` is increased by no. of tokens listed. Also a user can relist() a listed token. 
```solidity
function createListings(CreateListing[] calldata _createListings) public nonReentrant lockerNotPaused {
...
            // Increment our listings count
            unchecked {
@>              listingCount[listing.collection] += tokensIdsLength;
            }
...
    }
```

However, not only listed tokens but `floor tokens` (ie which is directly deposited in Locker.sol contract through Locker:deposit()) can also be directly relisted using relist(). But the problem is relist() doesn't increase the listingCount, which means when floor tokens are listed, they are not `counted`.
[Listing:relist()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L625C5-L672C6)

This is happening because relist() `assumes` that only listed tokens can be `relisted`

Let's the problem because of that:
1. When a listed token is filled using `listing:fillListings()` then listedCount is decreased, but that is in unchecked box, which means it will silently `arithmetic underflow`
```solidity
function _fillListing(address _collection, address _collectionToken, uint _tokenId) private {
...
 @>         unchecked { listingCount[_collection] -= 1; }
...
    }
```
2. But the biggest problem is, `listingCount` is used in `CollectionShutdown.sol` to ensure that there is no listing of that collection before `executing` the collection sunset.
```solidity
function execute(address _collection, uint[] calldata _tokenIds) public onlyOwner whenNotPaused {
...
        // Check that no listings currently exist
@>      if (_hasListings(_collection)) revert ListingsExist();
...
    }
```
```solidity
 /**
     * Checks if there are listings or protected listings for a collection.
     */
    function _hasListings(address _collection) internal view returns (bool) {
        IListings listings = locker.listings();
        if (address(listings) != address(0)) {
@>          if (listings.listingCount(_collection) != 0) {
                return true;
            }
...
        return false;
    }
```

## Impact
Collection will be `sunset`, even after having a `listing`. Also, listingCount in _fillListings() will silently arithmetic underflow

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check in relist(),  if `oldListing.owner == address(0)` then update the listingCount by 1
```diff
+   if (oldListing.owner == address(0)) {
+            listingCount[_collection] += 1;
+        }
```
