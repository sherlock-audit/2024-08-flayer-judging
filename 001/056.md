# `_isLiquidation` mapping is not deleted in `listing:reserve()` when a liquidation tokenId is reserved

## Summary
`_isLiquidation` mapping is not deleted in `listing:reserve()` when a liquidation tokenId is reserved, causing newOwner to lose `taxRefunds`

## Vulnerability Detail
When a protected listing is liquidated using `liquidateProtectedListing()`, it calls `listings:createLiquidationListing()`, which sets the `_isLiquidation` mapping for that collection & tokenId to `true`.
```solidity
function liquidateProtectedListing(address _collection, uint _tokenId) public lockerNotPaused listingExists(_collection, _tokenId) {
...
@>      _listings.createLiquidationListing(
            IListings.CreateListing({
                collection: _collection,
                tokenIds: tokenIds,
                listing: IListings.Listing({
                    owner: listing.owner,
                    created: uint40(block.timestamp),
                    duration: 4 days,
                    floorMultiple: 400
                })
            })
        );
...
    }
```
```solidity
 function createLiquidationListing(CreateListing calldata _createListing) public nonReentrant lockerNotPaused {
...
        // Flag our listing as a liquidation
@>      _isLiquidation[_createListing.collection][_createListing.tokenIds[0]] = true;
...
    }
```
When a user reserve a tokenId then it creates a new protected listing in protectedLisiting.sol contract.
```solidity
 function reserve(address _collection, uint _tokenId, uint _collateral) public nonReentrant lockerNotPaused {
...
        uint[] memory tokenIds = new uint[](1);
        tokenIds[0] = _tokenId;
        IProtectedListings.CreateListing[] memory createProtectedListing = new IProtectedListings.CreateListing[](1);
        createProtectedListing[0] = IProtectedListings.CreateListing({
            collection: _collection,
            tokenIds: tokenIds,
            listing: IProtectedListings.ProtectedListing({
                owner: payable(address(this)),
                tokenTaken: uint96(1 ether - _collateral),
                checkpoint: 0 // Set in the `createListings` call
            })
        });

        // Create our listing, receiving the ERC20 into this contract
@>      protectedListings.createListings(createProtectedListing);
...
    }
```
Now the problem is, reserve() doesn't deletes the `_isLiquidation` mapping if token is liquidation, which creates problem for that  tokenId in future.

1. Suppose tokenId = 1 is liquidated in protectedListing.sol, which creates a liquidation listing in Listing.sol using `createLiquidationListing()`, therefore `_isLiquidation = true` for tokenId = 1
2. UserA reserved that tokenId = 1 using reserve(), which creates a protected listing but doesn't delete the `_isLiquidation` mapping
3. UserA `unlocked` his tokenId = 1 from protectedListing using `unlockProtectedListing()`, ie now tokenId = 1 is in user's hand
4. UserA then created a listing in listing.sol using `listing:createListings()` for tokenId = 1, after paying tax ie `listingTax`
5. UserB buy tokenId = 1 using `listing:fillListings()`. fillListings() checks ` _isLiquidation` & if `_isLiquidation = true` then `no` taxAmount will be refunded, which means UserA will not receive any taxRefund because `_isLiquidation` was not deleted/cleared at reserve()
```solidity
function _fillListing(address _collection, address _collectionToken, uint _tokenId) private {
...
        if (_listings[_collection][_tokenId].owner != address(0)) {
            // Check if there is collateral on the listing, as this we bypass fees and refunds
@>          if (!_isLiquidation[_collection][_tokenId]) {
                // Find the amount of prepaid tax from current timestamp to prepaid timestamp
                // and refund unused gas to the user.
@>              (uint fee, uint refund) = _resolveListingTax(_listings[_collection][_tokenId], _collection, false);
                emit ListingFeeCaptured(_collection, _tokenId, fee);

                assembly {
                    tstore(FILL_FEE, add(tload(FILL_FEE), fee))
                    tstore(FILL_REFUND, add(tload(FILL_REFUND), refund))
                }
            } else {
                delete _isLiquidation[_collection][_tokenId];
            }
...
    }
```

## Impact
Owner will lose `taxRefund` if he listed tokenId bought from reserve()

Delete the `_isLiquidation` in reserve()
```diff
+ delete _isLiquidation[_collection][_tokenId];
```
