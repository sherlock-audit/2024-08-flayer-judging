# Users cannot unlock/repay their protected listing when the Locker is paused

### Summary

Users cannot repay or unlock their protected listing when Locker is paused, this can lead to liquidation of their protected asset leading to a loss for an honest user

### Root Cause

[`unlockProtectedListing(...)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L287) is used to repay a protected listing's position and optionally redeem their token immediately. However, the problem is that users are blocked from making this repayment when the Locker is locked leading to a possible liquidation of the user and I beleive this is a design flaw considering that there is an option for the user to repay and let their asset remain in the `Locker` for later withdrawal. 

```solidity
File: ProtectedListings.sol
287: @>  function unlockProtectedListing(address _collection, uint _tokenId, bool _withdraw) public lockerNotPaused {
288:         // Ensure this is a protected listing
289:         ProtectedListing memory listing = _protectedListings[_collection][_tokenId];
290: 
291:         // Ensure the caller owns the listing
292:         if (listing.owner != msg.sender) revert CallerIsNotOwner(listing.owner);
293: 

```

### Internal pre-conditions

Locker is paused

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- Alice wants to repay her loan that is on the verge of becoming unhealthy
- Locker is paused
- Alice call reverts
- By the time locker is unpaused, her position has become unhealthy and is due for liquidation

### Impact

Users canot repay when Locker is paused leading to liquidation of their protected listings

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider modifying the `unlockProtectedListing(...)` as shown below
