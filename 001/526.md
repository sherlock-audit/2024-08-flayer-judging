# Users Can Block the Owner from Executing a Collection Shutdown by Creating Listings

### Summary


In the `CollectionShutdown` contract, malicious users can block a scheduled shutdown of a collection by creating new listings after the shutdown has been scheduled. This prevents the contract owner from executing the shutdown and voters from reclaiming their votes.



### Root Cause


When the number of votes required for a collection to be shutdown is reached and thus scheduled for a shutdown, the contract owner will call [CollectionShutdown::execute](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L231-L276) to implement a complete collection shutdown.

But due to this check:
```solidity
    if (_hasListings(_collection)) revert ListingsExist();
```
malicious users can block the owner from shutting down the collection by creating listings after the collection has been scheduled for shutdown, this will also block voters from reclaiming their votes if the shutdown has been indefinitely delayed, due to the below check in [CollectionShutdown::reclaimVote](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L356-L377) function:
```solidity
        if (params.canExecute) revert ShutdownQuorumHasPassed();
```



### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact


Voters will be blocked from reclaiming their votes, thus having their tokens indefinitely stuck in the CollectionShutdown contract

### Mitigation

Consider restricting any more listing creations if a collection has been marked to be shut down.

Could make [_collectionParams](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L61) mapping public and then queried during listing creation in the listing contracts, if `canExecute` equals true then revert.
