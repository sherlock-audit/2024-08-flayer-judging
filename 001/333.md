# Malicious attacker can brick users claiming sale proceeds from collection shutdown by reclaiming vote

## Summary
A malicious attacker can brick users claiming sale proceeds from a collection shutdown by reclaiming their vote after collection shutdown execution is in progress.
## Vulnerability Detail
Once the final step of a collection shutdown is initiated with [`execute()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L231-L275), all NFTs are sent to a sudoswap pool for sale. Once all are sold, voters for the shutdown (which vote with `collectionTokens`) can [claim their share](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L285-L315) of the sale proceeds.

A [`cancel()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L390-L405) function is also present in the contract which allows users to cancel the shutdown if they wish to (before `execute()` is called), as long as the `collectionToken.totalSupply > MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS`, but the inverse check is not enforced in `execute()` (as it is in [`start()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L147)). In other words, even if the total supply has risen after `start()` but before `execute()`, if no one wishes to cancel, the execute will take into account the new supply, [adjust quorum](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L243-L248) and still execute.

```solidity
    // Refresh total supply here to ensure that any assets that were added during
    // the shutdown process can also claim their share.
    uint newQuorum = params.collectionToken.totalSupply() * SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT / ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT;
    if (params.quorumVotes != newQuorum) {
        params.quorumVotes = uint88(newQuorum);
    }
```

Now let's look at when a user can [`reclaimVote()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L356-L377):

```solidity
    // If the quorum has passed, then we can no longer reclaim as we are pending
    // an execution.
    CollectionShutdownParams storage params = _collectionParams[_collection];
    if (params.canExecute) revert ShutdownQuorumHasPassed();
```

If votes have surpassed quorum and the vote can be executed, they cannot reclaim their vote anymore. The flaw is that once the actual `execute()` is called, [this flag is set to false again](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L273), essentially, the user can reclaim their vote AFTER `execute()` is already in progress.

By reclaiming their vote, they can [vote again](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L191-L214), which will once again set the `canExecute` flag to true:

```solidity
        // If we can execute, then we need to fire another event
        if (!params.canExecute && params.shutdownVotes >= params.quorumVotes) {
            params.canExecute = true;
            emit CollectionShutdownQuorumReached(_collection);
        }
```

The attacker manipulates the checks by reclaiming their vote after the execution is underway and re-voting. Once the `canExecute` flag is put up again, the user can now call [`cancel()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L390-L405) and by doing so, delete all data of `_collectionParams[_collection]`:

```solidity
    if (!params.canExecute) revert ShutdownNotReachedQuorum();
    ...
    delete _collectionParams[_collection];
```

Once that is done, no one will be able to claim their sale proceeds because of this check in [`claim()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L285C14-L315):

```solidity
    // Ensure that we have moved token IDs to the pool
    CollectionShutdownParams memory params = _collectionParams[_collection];
    if (params.sweeperPool == address(0)) revert ShutdownNotExecuted();
```

The whole flow of attack:

1. Collection shutdown starts, 4 users each own 1 `collectionToken`
2. After voting starts, 1 user (which is malicious) deposits another NFT so that `collectionToken.totalSupply > MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS` (this will allow him to call cancel later)
3. Everyone votes and quorum is reached, `execute()` can now be called
4. Keep in mind shutdown will still execute since a check for max tokens is only enforced in `start()`, while in `execute()` it just adjusts quorum based on new supply. None of the other 3 participants calls `cancel()` since the supply only increased by 1 and they want to get rid of their tokens anyway
5. `execute()` is called and `params.canExecute` is set to false
6. Malicious user calls `reclaimVote()`
7. Malicious user calls `vote()` again and `params.canExecute` flag is set to true again
8. Malicious user now calls `cancel()`, `canExecute` is true so check passes, as well as `collectionToken.totalSupply > MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS` check passes
9. `_collectionParams[_collection]` is deleted and no one can claim their sale proceeds due to `if (params.sweeperPool == address(0)) revert ShutdownNotExecuted()` check 


This is made possible by multiple flaws in the design, as well as allowing to call `execute()` even after the total supply has risen. If it enforced a strict check like in `start()` this would not be possible.


## Impact
Loss of funds for all shutdown voters since they can never claim the sale proceeds. The attacker can repeat this whole process for multiple collections and grief.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    // Ensure that we have moved token IDs to the pool
    CollectionShutdownParams memory params = _collectionParams[_collection];
    if (params.sweeperPool == address(0)) revert ShutdownNotExecuted();
```

## Recommendation
Don't allow users to reclaim their vote after `execute()` has been called.
