# Quorum votes downcasting in `CollectionShutdown.sol` leads to lower quorum and stolen funds

### Summary

The [CollectionShutdown](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol) contract uses a `uint88` variable to keep track of the amount of votes necessary to reach the quorum, but 88 bits are not enough. This makes it possible for the quorum to be downcasted, leading to the quorum being lower than expected and funds being stolen/lost.

### Root Cause

The quorum is calculated as [half the total supply](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L150) of collection tokens.

The maximum total supply possible when calculating the quorum is defined [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L147) and amounts to:

$$\text{MAXSHUTDOWNTOKENS} \cdot 10^{\text{params.collectionToken.denomination()}} = (4 \cdot 10^{18}\cdot 10^{9}) = 4 \cdot 10^{27}$$

Because the quorum is `50%`, the maximum possible quorum is `4e27/2` votes, which is bigger than `2^88` and thus risks of being downcasted.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The supply of collection tokens when either [CollectionShutdown::start()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L135) or [CollectionShutdown::execute()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L231) is called must be greater than `2^88`. This is only possible for collections with a denomination of either `8` or `9`.

### Attack Path

### Impact

There's two main impacts:

1. If the quorum gets downcasted the amount of votes necessary to shutdown a collection will be lower than expected.
2. Because [CollectionShutdown::claim()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L310) uses the quorum as a denominator to determine the amount of ETH that can be claimed users who claim first will claim more than expected and steal funds from other collections shutdowns and/or future claimers.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Use a bigger variable to hold the quorum votes, like `uint96`.
