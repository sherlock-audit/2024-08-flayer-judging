# When a liquidationListing is relisted, owner receives taxRefund, which should not

## Summary
When a liquidationListing is relisted, owner receives taxRefund, which should not because liquidationListing is created without paying any tax ie listingTax

## Vulnerability Detail
User can relist any tokenId using `listing:relist()`, which returns any taxRefund to previousOwner using _resolveListingTax()
```solidity
function relist(CreateListing calldata _listing, bool _payTaxWithEscrow) public nonReentrant lockerNotPaused {
...
        // We can process a tax refund for the existing listing
@>      (uint _fees,) = _resolveListingTax(oldListing, _collection, true);
        if (_fees != 0) {
            emit ListingFeeCaptured(_collection, _tokenId, _fees);
        }
...
    }
```
Now the problem is, relist() doesn't check if the tokenId is `_isLiquidation` or not. As result, when a liquidationListing is relisted, owner of a liquidationListing receives a taxRefund in _resolveListingTax() even though `no` tax is paid while creating a `createLiquidationListing()`
```solidity
function _resolveListingTax(Listing memory _listing, address _collection, bool _action) private returns (uint fees_, uint refund_) {
...
        // Get the amount of tax to be refunded. If the listing has already ended
        // then no refund will be offered.
        if (block.timestamp < _listing.created + _listing.duration) {
@>          refund_ = (_listing.duration - (block.timestamp - _listing.created)) * taxPaid / _listing.duration;
        }
...
        if (_action) {
...
            // If there is tax to refund, then allocate it to the user via escrow
            if (refund_ != 0) {
@>              _deposit(_listing.owner, address(collectionToken), refund_);
            }
        }
    }
```

## Impact
Lose of funds for the protocol as owner receives `taxRefunds` which he didn't pay while creating a liquidationListing

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check if tokenId relisting is liquidationListing or not then make refund.
```diff
+           if (!_isLiquidation[_collection][_tokenId]) {
+               (uint _fees,) = _resolveListingTax(oldListing, _collection, true);
+               if (_fees != 0) {
+                   emit ListingFeeCaptured(_collection, _tokenId, _fees);
+               }
+           }
