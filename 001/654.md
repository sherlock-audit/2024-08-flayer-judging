# Whales can use CollectionShutdown.reclaimVote to inflate the voting first, and withdraw their portion after collectionLiquidation has been completed

## Summary
I argue that it's not fair for the other users to participate in a voting that can be manipulated after the liquidation of a collection has been executed, because that enables large whales to get a large portion of the total supply of a `collectionToken` after most of the users have already `claim`ed or `voteAndClaim`ed already.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `reclaimVote` function allows retracting the user's votes after the `quorum` has already been reached, potentially maliciously by whales, and after `execute` has been called for a `_collection` and it has been sunset in the `Locker`:
```solidity
    /**
     * If the user changes their mind regarding their vote, then they can retract it
     * at any time. This will remove their vote and return their token.
     *
     * @param _collection The collection address
     */
    function reclaimVote(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
        // If the quorum has passed, then we can no longer reclaim as we are pending
        // an execution.
        CollectionShutdownParams storage params = _collectionParams[_collection];
        if (params.canExecute) revert ShutdownQuorumHasPassed();

        // Get the amount of votes that the user has cast for this collection
        uint userVotes = shutdownVoters[_collection][msg.sender];

        // If the user has not cast a vote, then we can revert early
        if (userVotes == 0) revert NoVotesPlacedYet();

        // We delete the votes that the user has attributed to the collection
        params.shutdownVotes -= uint96(userVotes);
        delete shutdownVoters[_collection][msg.sender];

        // We can now return their tokens
        params.collectionToken.transfer(msg.sender, userVotes);

        // Notify our stalkers that a vote has been reclaimed
        emit CollectionShutdownVoteReclaim(_collection, msg.sender, userVotes);
    }
```

## Impact
That happens because `canExecute` is set to `false` after `execute` is called, which is designed as a replay protection for the `execute` function, but opens a new attack vector to gain most of the supply of the `collectionToken` without losing anything.

## Tool used
Manual review.

## Recommendation
Consider adding the following check:
```diff
    function reclaimVote(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
+       require(collectionLiquidationComplete(_collection) == false);

        // If the quorum has passed, then we can no longer reclaim as we are pending
        // an execution.
        CollectionShutdownParams storage params = _collectionParams[_collection];
        if (params.canExecute) revert ShutdownQuorumHasPassed();

        // Get the amount of votes that the user has cast for this collection
        uint userVotes = shutdownVoters[_collection][msg.sender];

        // If the user has not cast a vote, then we can revert early
        if (userVotes == 0) revert NoVotesPlacedYet();

        // We delete the votes that the user has attributed to the collection
        params.shutdownVotes -= uint96(userVotes);
        delete shutdownVoters[_collection][msg.sender];

        // We can now return their tokens
        params.collectionToken.transfer(msg.sender, userVotes);

        // Notify our stalkers that a vote has been reclaimed
        emit CollectionShutdownVoteReclaim(_collection, msg.sender, userVotes);
    }
```
