# Borrowers can bypass interest payments and pay off principal until 0.06 ether remains

### Summary

When decreasing debt with [`adjustPosition()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L380-L399), the interest is not recorded nor is it paid for by the borrower. The amount paid is directly deducted from the principal. 

```solidity
    uint absAmount = uint(_amount < 0 ? -_amount : _amount);
    
    // cache
    ICollectionToken collectionToken = locker.collectionToken(_collection);
    
    // Check if we are decreasing debt
    if (_amount < 0) {
        if (debt + int(absAmount) >= int(MAX_PROTECTED_TOKEN_AMOUNT)) revert IncorrectFunctionUse();
    
        // Take tokens from the caller
        collectionToken.transferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            absAmount * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination()
        );
    
        // Update the struct to reflect the new tokenTaken, protecting from overflow
        // @audit `tokenTaken` is the principal and this directly deducts the payment from the principal without paying interest.
        _protectedListings[_collection][_tokenId].tokenTaken -= uint96(absAmount);
    }
```

The principal can be decreased down to 0.06e18 at most.

### Root Cause

[`adjustPosition()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L399) allows borrowers to bypass interest payments since they reduce their debt without paying interest owed.

```solidity
    _protectedListings[_collection][_tokenId].tokenTaken -= uint96(absAmount);
```

In [`unlockProtectedListing()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L303-L305), the loaned amount plus the interest is paid for.

```solidity
    // Repay the loaned amount, plus a fee from lock duration
    // @audit unlockPrice = principal + interest
    uint fee = unlockPrice(_collection, _tokenId) * 10 ** denomination;
    collectionToken.burnFrom(msg.sender, fee);
```

### Attack Path

1. Borrower [creates a protected listing](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L117) and borrows 0.5e18 fTokens.
2. After some time and before the protected listing can be liquidated, the borrower calls [`adjustPosition()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L386-L399) to pay off 0.44e18 of their loan. This gets deducted directly from the principal and they bypass any interest payments for the locked duration.

### Impact

Borrowers can bypass interest payments on their loan by using [`adjustPosition()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L366) instead of [`unlockProtectedListing()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L287).

The protocol loses greater than 90% of the interest fees.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider adjusting the amount deducted from the principal to account for the interest fee payments in [`adjustPosition()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L386-L399).
