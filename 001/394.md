# Users can get away without paying the tax and reducing their token taken value close to zero.

## Summary

Impact: loss of yield to LPs by users adjusting their protected listing's token taken state.
Root cause: lack of tax charging before modifying token taken.
A simple fix is to charge the tax before updating and then update the token taken and also update the chekcpoint index for the user.

## Vulnerability Detail

Issue flow :
1. User lists BAYC 200 as protected and the token taken is 0.5 ether.
2. after 10 days, the unlock price becomes 0.55 ether (10% tax for 10 days), so 0.05 ether tax is incurred.
3. Now user calls `adjustPosition` with +0.45 ether as `_amount` parameter.
4. Since the `debt`= 0.95 - 0.55(unlock price) = 0.40 ether, inside the if block on line 378 will pass, 0.40 + 0.45 is < 0.95
5. On line 392, the token taken is reduced from 0.5 to 0.05 by pulling 0.45 ether of tokens from user. 

The issue here is, the reduction in token taken is done without charging the tax for the past 10 days for the 0.5 ether taken. The tax was 0.05 ether and the user got away without paying it. So loss of yeild to LPS in uniV4 pool. 

Since the updated token taken now is 0.05 ether, the tax it will incur when he unlocks it will be 10% of 0.05, which is 0.005 ether and he pays that tax + 0.05 taken in the unlock listing call. So, the tax of 0.5 - 0.005 = 0.0045 ether is saved. Around 90% saved.

383:                 address(this),
384:                 absAmount * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination()
385:             );
386: 
387:             // Update the struct to reflect the new tokenTaken, protecting from overflow
392:  >>>        _protectedListings[_collection][_tokenId].tokenTaken -= uint96(absAmount);
393:         }
394:         // Otherwise, the user is increasing their debt to take more token
395:         else {
 ---- SNIP ----
413:         }
414: 
415:         emit ListingDebtAdjusted(_collection, _tokenId, _amount);
416:     }

```


## Impact
Users can save tax on their protected listing for over > 90% of tax for their original token-taken amounts. This is a loss to LPs. And the likelihood is also always. Breaking the core contract's finality of tax charging.

1. update the checkpoint and assign the latest checkpoint index to the user's listing struct
2. collect the tax for the previous token taken and deposit as fees to uniswap implementation
3. Then do as it is, reducing the token taken state.
