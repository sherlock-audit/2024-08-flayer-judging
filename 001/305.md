# Liquidation not possible when protected listings have effectively run out of collateral

### Summary

A protected listing (also called 'a loan') cannot be liquidated when it effectively runs out of collateral. It needs to be at a loss – have negative collateral – in order to be liquidated due to a wrong comparison.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L432
```solidity
    function liquidateProtectedListing(address _collection, uint _tokenId) public lockerNotPaused listingExists(_collection, _tokenId) {
        // Ensure that the protected listing has run out of collateral
        int collateral = getProtectedListingHealth(_collection, _tokenId);
→       if (collateral >= 0) revert ListingStillHasCollateral();

        // ...
    }
```

The **ProtectedListings** `liquidateProtectedListing()` function checks if the remaining collateral of a loan position is greater than or equal to zero, when it should instead check only if `collateral > 0` and revert only then as having 0 remaining collateral effectively means you have **no** collateral.


### Internal pre-conditions

Have a loan position (protected listing) that has become liquidateable due to too much borrowed CollectionTokens or due to a raised interest rate.


### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User borrows collection tokens by reserving an ordinary listing or by creating a protected listing directly.
2. Interest rates rise due to higher utilization of a collection.
3. The user's loan position is now liquidateable because they borrowed close to the limit or because interest rates have risen rapidly. The loan's health now is `0`.
4. Liquidator see that and decides to liquidate them as the position is effectively underwater.
5. `liquidateProtectedListing()` reverts preventing the proper liquidation of the loan.

### Impact

Loan positions will need to accrue bad debt in order to be liquidated instead of allowing liquidators to liquidate such positions in a timely manner.
