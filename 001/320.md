# Fail to start one shut down flow if the collection was shut down before.

## Summary
We cannot start one shutdown flow if this collection was shutdown before.

## Vulnerability Detail
When one collection market is shut down, we can recreate this collection market via createCollection() if the collection market becomes active again. It's possible that we will trigger the same collection's shutdown flow several times.
The problem is that when voters claim rewards, we miss updating the `_collectionParams[_collection].shutdownVotes`. When we try to start this collection's shutdown flow for a second time, this will be reverted because `params.shutdownVotes != 0`.

```solidity
    function claim(address _collection, address payable _claimant) public nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        ...
        CollectionShutdownParams memory params = _collectionParams[_collection];
        if (params.sweeperPool == address(0)) revert ShutdownNotExecuted();
        if (!collectionLiquidationComplete(_collection)) revert NotAllTokensSold();
        if (params.sweeperPoolTokenIds.length != 0) {
            delete _collectionParams[_collection].sweeperPoolTokenIds;
        }
        params.collectionToken.burn(claimableVotes);
@> Missing decrease `_collectionParams[_collection].shutdownVotes`
@>        delete shutdownVoters[_collection][_claimant];

        uint amount = params.availableClaim * claimableVotes / (params.quorumVotes * ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT / SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT);
        (bool sent,) = _claimant.call{value: amount}('');
        if (!sent) revert FailedToClaim();

        emit CollectionShutdownClaim(_collection, _claimant, claimableVotes, amount);
    }
```
```solidity
    function start(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
        ...
        CollectionShutdownParams memory params = _collectionParams[_collection];
@revert>        if (params.shutdownVotes != 0) revert ShutdownProcessAlreadyStarted();
        ...
    }
```
## Impact
We cannot start one shutdown flow if this collection was shutdown before.

## Recommendation
Timely update `_collectionParams[_collection].shutdownVotes` when we claim rewards.
