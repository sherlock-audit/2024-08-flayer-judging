# The health of a ```ProtectedListing``` is incorrectly calculated if the ```tokenTaken``` has be changed through ```ProtectedListings::adjustPosition()```.

### Summary

```ProtectedListings::adjustPosition()``` will change the ```tokenTaken``` but after this, ```ProtectedListings::getProtectedListingHealth()``` will assume that these ```tokenTaken``` has been the same as the starting ones and will incorrectly compound them.

### Root Cause

A user can create a ```ProtectedListing``` by calling ```ProtectedListings::createPosition()```, deposit his token and take back an amount ```tokenTake``` as debt. This amount is supposed to be compounded through the time depending on the newest compound factor and the compound factor when the position was created. However, when the user calls ```ProtectedListings::adjustPosition()``` and take some more debt, this new debt will be assume it will be there from the start and it will be compounded as such in ```ProtectedListings::getProtectedListingHealth()``` while this is not the case and it will be compounded from the moment it got taken. Let's have a look on ```ProtectedListings::adjustPosition()``` :
```solidity
    function adjustPosition(address _collection, uint _tokenId, int _amount) public lockerNotPaused {
        // ...

        // Get the current debt of the position
@>        int debt = getProtectedListingHealth(_collection, _tokenId);

        // ...

        // Check if we are decreasing debt
        if (_amount < 0) {
            // ...

            // Update the struct to reflect the new tokenTaken, protecting from overflow
@>            _protectedListings[_collection][_tokenId].tokenTaken -= uint96(absAmount);
        }
        // Otherwise, the user is increasing their debt to take more token
        else {
           // ...

            // Update the struct to reflect the new tokenTaken, protecting from overflow
@>            _protectedListings[_collection][_tokenId].tokenTaken += uint96(absAmount);
        }

        // ...
    }
```

As we can see, this function just increases or decreases the ```tokenTaken``` of this ```ProtectedListings``` meaning the debt that the owner should repay. Now, if we see the ```ProtectedListings::getProtectedListingHealth()```, we will understand that function just takes the ```tokenTaken``` and compounds it without caring **when** this ```tokenTaken``` increased or decreased :
```solidity
    function getProtectedListingHealth(address _collection, uint _tokenId) public view listingExists(_collection, _tokenId) returns (int) {
        // So we start at a whole token, minus: the keeper fee, the amount of tokens borrowed
        // and the amount of collateral based on the protected tax.
@>        return int(MAX_PROTECTED_TOKEN_AMOUNT) - int(unlockPrice(_collection, _tokenId));
    }

    function unlockPrice(address _collection, uint _tokenId) public view returns (uint unlockPrice_) {
        // Get the information relating to the protected listing
        ProtectedListing memory listing = _protectedListings[_collection][_tokenId];

        // Calculate the final amount using the compounded factors and principle amount
        unlockPrice_ = locker.taxCalculator().compound({
@>            _principle: listing.tokenTaken,
            _initialCheckpoint: collectionCheckpoints[_collection][listing.checkpoint],
            _currentCheckpoint: _currentCheckpoint(_collection)
        });
    }
```

So, it will take this ```tokenTaken``` and it will compound it from the start of the ```ProtectedListing``` until now, while it shouldn't be the case since some debt may have been added later (through ```ProtectedListings::adjustPosition()```) and in this way this amount must be compounded from the moment it got taken until now, not from the start.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. User creates a ```ProtectedListing``` through ```ProtectedListings::createListings()```.

### External pre-conditions

1. User wants take some debt on his ```ProtectedListing```.

### Attack Path

1. Firstly, user calls ```ProtectedListings::createListings()``` and creates a ```ProtectedListing``` with ```tokenTaken``` and expecting them to compound.
2. After some time and the initial ```tokenTaken``` have been compounded a bit, user decides to take some more debt and increase ```tokenTaken``` and calls ```ProtectedListings::adjustListing()``` to take ```x``` more debt.
3. Now, ```ProtectedListings::getProtectedListingHealth()``` shows that the ```x``` more debt is compounded like it was taken from the very start of the ```ProtectedListing``` creation and in this way his debt is unfairly more inflated.

### Impact

The impact of this serious vulnerability is that the user is being in more debt than what he should have been, since he accrues interest for a period that he had not actually taken that debt. In this way, while he expects his ```tokenTaken``` to be increased by ```x``` amount (as it would be fairly happen), he sees his debt to be inflated by ```x compounded```. This can cause instant and unfair liquidations and **loss of funds** for users unfairly taken into more debt.

### PoC

No PoC needed.

### Mitigation

To mitigate this vulnerability successfully, consider updating the checkpoints of the ```ProtectedListing``` whenever an adjustment is happening in the ```position```, so the debt to be compounded correctly.
