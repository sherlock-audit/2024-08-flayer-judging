# [execute()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L231) is run even though `collectionToken.totalSupply()` is larger than 4 ether.

### Summary

According to prtocol flow, if `collectionToken.totalSupply()` is larger than 4 ether, collection can not be shutdown. But in `execute()` of `CollectionShutdown.sol`, `collectionToken.totalSupply()` is not checked.

### Root Cause

In `execute()` of `CollectionShutdown.sol`, `collectionToken.totalSupply()` is not checked.

### Internal pre-conditions

The `collectionToken.totalSupply()` is larger than 4 ether.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

User can not call [`reclaimVote()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L356) so that all funds corresponding to `collection` may be locked in the contract.

### PoC

According to sponsor, "So that is in place to prevent active or popular collections from being shutdown. I believe the MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS is 4, so if there are more than 4 ERC20 tokens in circulation then the pool is deemed active and the shutdown process is prevented".
```solidity
    function execute(address _collection, uint[] calldata _tokenIds) public onlyOwner whenNotPaused {
        // Ensure that the vote count has reached quorum
        CollectionShutdownParams storage params = _collectionParams[_collection];
        if (!params.canExecute) revert ShutdownNotReachedQuorum();

        // Ensure we have specified token IDs
        uint _tokenIdsLength = _tokenIds.length;
        if (_tokenIdsLength == 0) revert NoNFTsSupplied();

        // Check that no listings currently exist
        if (_hasListings(_collection)) revert ListingsExist();

        // Refresh total supply here to ensure that any assets that were added during
        // the shutdown process can also claim their share.
        uint newQuorum = params.collectionToken.totalSupply() * SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT / ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT;
        if (params.quorumVotes != newQuorum) {
            params.quorumVotes = uint88(newQuorum);
        }

        // Lockdown the collection to prevent any new interaction
        locker.sunsetCollection(_collection);

        // Iterate over our token IDs and transfer them to this contract
        IERC721 collection = IERC721(_collection);
        for (uint i; i < _tokenIdsLength; ++i) {
            locker.withdrawToken(_collection, _tokenIds[i], address(this));
        }

        // Approve sudoswap pair factory to use our NFTs
        collection.setApprovalForAll(address(pairFactory), true);

        // Map our collection to a newly created pair
        address pool = _createSudoswapPool(collection, _tokenIds);

        // Set the token IDs that have been sent to our sweeper pool
        params.sweeperPoolTokenIds = _tokenIds;
        sweeperPoolCollection[pool] = _collection;

        // Update our collection parameters with the pool
        params.sweeperPool = pool;

        // Prevent the collection from being executed again
        params.canExecute = false;
        emit CollectionShutdownExecuted(_collection, pool, _tokenIds);
    }
```
As you can see, in `execute()` there is not check of `collectionToken.totalSupply()`.

### Mitigation

Pls add check of `collectionToken.totalSupply()` to `execute()`.
