# Users will suffer unexpected liquidations and unfair interest charges on Protected Listings

### Summary

The incorrect interest calculation and position adjustment mechanism in the ProtectedListings contract will cause an unfair interest accrual and potential immediate liquidation for borrowers as users will increase their borrowed amount without proper interest recalculation.

### Root Cause

In ProtectedListings.sol, the choice to use a single checkpoint and tokenTaken value for interest calculation is a mistake as it does not accurately account for position adjustments over time.

Position Adjustment Mechanism:
In ProtectedListings.sol, the adjustPosition() function only updates the tokenTaken value:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L413
```solidity
function adjustPosition(address _collection, uint _tokenId, int _amount) public lockerNotPaused {
    // ... (input validation)

    if (_amount < 0) {
        // Decreasing debt
        _protectedListings[_collection][_tokenId].tokenTaken -= uint96(absAmount);
    } else {
        // Increasing debt
        _protectedListings[_collection][_tokenId].tokenTaken += uint96(absAmount);
    }

    // ... (token transfers)

    emit ListingDebtAdjusted(_collection, _tokenId, _amount);
}
```

Interest Calculation:
The unlockPrice() function calculates interest based on the current tokenTaken amount and the initial checkpoint:

```solidity
function unlockPrice(address _collection, uint _tokenId) public view returns (uint unlockPrice_) {
    ProtectedListing memory listing = _protectedListings[_collection][_tokenId];

    unlockPrice_ = locker.taxCalculator().compound({
        _principle: listing.tokenTaken,
        _initialCheckpoint: collectionCheckpoints[_collection][listing.checkpoint],
        _currentCheckpoint: _currentCheckpoint(_collection)
    });
}
```
**This calculation assumes the entire tokenTaken amount was borrowed from the initial checkpoint, which is incorrect for adjusted positions.**

Position Health Calculation:
The getProtectedListingHealth() function uses the unlockPrice() result:

```solidity
function getProtectedListingHealth(address _collection, uint _tokenId) public view listingExists(_collection, _tokenId) returns (int) {
    return int(MAX_PROTECTED_TOKEN_AMOUNT) - int(unlockPrice(_collection, _tokenId));
}
```
This can lead to an incorrect low health value for adjusted positions.

Liquidation Check:
The liquidateProtectedListing() function uses the health calculation:

```solidity
function liquidateProtectedListing(address _collection, uint _tokenId) public lockerNotPaused listingExists(_collection, _tokenId) {
    int collateral = getProtectedListingHealth(_collection, _tokenId);
    if (collateral >= 0) revert ListingStillHasCollateral();
    // ... (liquidation logic)
}
```
This can allow for immediate liquidation after a position adjustment due to the inflated interest calculation as the check during adjustposition doesnot account for this ` if (_amount > debt) revert InsufficientCollateral();` where debt is remaining collateral without taking any interest into account.

### Attack Path

1. User creates a protected listing, borrowing an initial amount.
2. Time passes, and interest accrues on the initial borrowed amount.
3. User calls adjustPosition() to increase their borrowed amount.
4. The tokenTaken value in the ProtectedListing struct is updated, but the checkpoint remains the same.
5. When unlockPrice() is called (e.g., during liquidation check), it calculates interest as if the entire current tokenTaken amount was borrowed from the initial checkpoint.
6. This results in an inflated interest amount, potentially pushing the position into a liquidatable state immediately.

### Impact

The borrowers suffer unfair interest charges and potential immediate, unexpected liquidations. The protocol gains excessive interest at the expense of borrowers, violating the intended fairness of the system.
