# Non-existent checkpoint index is used when creating Protected Listings

### Summary

When creating new protected listings, a non-existent checkpoint index will be used when there are checkpoints for a collection. These protected listings can not be adjusted or unlocked until the non-existent checkpoint is created.

### Root Cause

In [`ProtectedListings::_createCheckpoint():564-567`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L564-L567), the latest checkpoint is updated. However, the incorrect index is returned.

```solidity
    if (checkpoint.timestamp == collectionCheckpoints[_collection][index_ - 1].timestamp) {
        collectionCheckpoints[_collection][index_ - 1].compoundedFactor = checkpoint.compoundedFactor;
        // @audit the correct index is `index_ - 1` since `index_` does not exist yet.
        return index_;
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. At least 1 checkpoint has been created for a collection. This happens when a listing has been created for a collection. Every listing created afterward will experience this issue.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Anyone [creates a listing](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L117-L156) for a collection. This [creates a new checkpoint](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L532-L557) when no checkpoints exist yet.
2. Anyone [creates another listing](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L117-L156) for the same collection in the same block. The latest [checkpoint is updated](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L564-L567) but the checkpoint used for the new listing does not exist yet.

### Impact

All functions that use [`unlockPrice()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L614) are affected. The affected functions are:

- [liquidateProtectedListings()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L431)
- [adjustPosition()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L377)
- [unlockPrice()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L614)
- [unlockProtectedListing()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L295)
- [getProtectedListingHealth()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L500)

All affected functions called with the new listings [will revert](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L614) until the non-existent checkpoint is created. This will happen for every new listing.

ref: [`ProtectedListings::unlockPrice():614`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L614)
```solidity
  // @audit this will revert due to out-of-bounds access until the non-existent checkpoint is created.
  _initialCheckpoint: collectionCheckpoints[_collection][listing.checkpoint],
```

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider modifying `unlockPrice()` to return the correct index.

```solidity
-        return index_;
+       return index_ - 1;
```
