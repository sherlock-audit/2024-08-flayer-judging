# The shutdown can still be canceled after execute, causing users to fail to claim tokens.


## Summary
The shutdown can still be canceled after execute, causing users to fail to claim tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

CollectionShutdown, if `params.canExecute` is true and collectionToken.totalSupply > MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS_AMOUNT,
It can be cancelled, and anyone can call:

```solidity
    function cancel(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
        // Ensure that the vote count has reached quorum
        CollectionShutdownParams memory params = _collectionParams[_collection];
@>      if (!params.canExecute) revert ShutdownNotReachedQuorum();

        // Check if the total supply has surpassed an amount of the initial required
        // total supply. This would indicate that a collection has grown since the
        // initial shutdown was triggered and could result in an unsuspected liquidation.
@>      if (params.collectionToken.totalSupply() <= MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS * 10 ** locker.collectionToken(_collection).denomination()) {
            revert InsufficientTotalSupplyToCancel();
        }

        // Remove our execution flag
        delete _collectionParams[_collection];
        emit CollectionShutdownCancelled(_collection);
    }
```

The problem is that `cancel` may still be executed after `execute` is executed.

Although the execute function sets `params.canExecute` to false, which does not satisfy the first condition for cancel execution,

However, after the `execute` function, `vote` can still be called, and if an attacker(or honest user) calls `vote`, `params.canExecute` can be reset to true.

This time, if collectionToken `totalSupply > MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS_AMOUNT`, cancel can be executed.

The problem is that `execute` has already been executed and all the NFTS have been sent to sudoswap.

The claim function cannot be executed because `_collectionParams[_collection]` has been deleted, the token is then locked in the `CollectionShutdown` contract.

```solidity
    function claim(address _collection, address payable _claimant) public nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        // 没有验证msg.sender
        // Ensure our user has tokens to claim
        uint claimableVotes = shutdownVoters[_collection][_claimant];
        if (claimableVotes == 0) revert NoTokensAvailableToClaim();

        // Ensure that we have moved token IDs to the pool
@>      CollectionShutdownParams memory params = _collectionParams[_collection];
@>      if (params.sweeperPool == address(0)) revert ShutdownNotExecuted();
        .....
    }
```
## Impact
The user token is locked.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Set a clear state to prohibit calling claim after execute.
