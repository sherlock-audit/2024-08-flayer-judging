# Previous owner can `cancelListing()` or `modifyListing()` because reserve() doesn't deletes the `_listings` mapping

## Summary
Previous owner can `cancelListing()` or `modifyListing()` because reserve() doesn't deletes the `_listings` mapping

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user reserve() a listing, it doesn't deletes the `_listings` mapping which stores the info like `owner/ floorMultiple/ duration.`
```solidity
    function reserve(address _collection, uint _tokenId, uint _collateral) public nonReentrant lockerNotPaused {
//
        // Check if the listing is a floor item and process additional logic if there
        // was an owner (meaning it was not floor, so liquid or dutch).
        if (oldListing.owner != address(0)) {
            // We can process a tax refund for the existing listing if it isn't a liquidation
            if (!_isLiquidation[_collection][_tokenId]) {
                (uint _fees,) = _resolveListingTax(oldListing, _collection, true);
                if (_fees != 0) {
                    emit ListingFeeCaptured(_collection, _tokenId, _fees);
                }
            }

            // If the floor multiple of the original listings is different, then this needs
            // to be paid to the original owner of the listing.
            uint listingFloorPrice = 1 ether * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination();
            if (listingPrice > listingFloorPrice) {
                unchecked {
                    collectionToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, oldListing.owner, listingPrice - listingFloorPrice);
                }
            }

            // Reduce the amount of listings
            unchecked { listingCount[_collection] -= 1; }
        }
//
    }
```
Due to not deleting _listings mapping, previous owner can call cancelListing() & modifyListings().

If owner calls the canceListing(), it will withdraw that tokenId from locker.sol & when new owner will try to withdraw that tokenId from protectedListing.sol, it will revert as that tokenId will not be in Locker.sol
## Impact
Reserver will completely lose his NFT, if previous owner call the cancelListings()

Delete the _listings mapping when a tokenId is reserved
