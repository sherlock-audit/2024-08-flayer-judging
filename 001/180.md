# Already `executed/sunset` collection can be `cancel()`, preventing users from claiming their `ETH`

## Summary
Already `executed/sunset` collection can be `cancel()`, preventing users from claiming their `ETH`

## Vulnerability Detail
User can vote for a collection using `vote()`, which checks if `canExecute = false & shutdownVotes >=quorumVotes` then it sets canExecute = true.
```solidity
function _vote(address _collection, CollectionShutdownParams memory params) internal returns (CollectionShutdownParams memory) {
...
        // If we can execute, then we need to fire another event
@>      if (!params.canExecute && params.shutdownVotes >= params.quorumVotes) {
            params.canExecute = true;
            emit CollectionShutdownQuorumReached(_collection);
        }
...
    }
```

Owner can `execute/sunset` a collection using `execute()`, which creates a sudoswap pair & sets `canExecute = false`. Also, a collection can be cancelled using `cancel()`, for which canExecute should be `true`(keep this in mind)
```solidity
function execute(address _collection, uint[] calldata _tokenIds) public onlyOwner whenNotPaused {
...
        // Prevent the collection from being executed again
@>      params.canExecute = false;
        emit CollectionShutdownExecuted(_collection, pool, _tokenIds);
    }
```
```solidity
    function cancel(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
        // Ensure that the vote count has reached quorum
        CollectionShutdownParams memory params = _collectionParams[_collection];
@>      if (!params.canExecute) revert ShutdownNotReachedQuorum();
...

        // Remove our execution flag
@>      delete _collectionParams[_collection];
        emit CollectionShutdownCancelled(_collection);
    }
```

Now the problem is, vote doesn't check if a `collection` has been `executed or not`, which means a user can call vote() for a collection after its execution, which will again set the `canExecute = true`(see above vote() code)

A malicious user can take advantage of that and `cancel()` the already executed/sunset collection, which will delete the `_collectionParams` mapping, which stores `quorumVotes` & `availableClaim` that are used while claiming the ETH

Here is how this works:
1. Suppose a collection sunset is started & it reached the quorumVotes, which sets the canExecute = true
2. Owner executed the collection, which sets the canExecute = false. User can now start claiming their share of ETH(assume all NFTs are sold in sudoswap)
3. Malicious user voted for the collection using vote(), now canExecute = false(from execute()) & `shutdownVotes >=quorumVotes`, therefore `canExecute` will again be set to `true`
4. Malicious user will then call cancel()(to cancel any collection we need canExecute = true), which will delete the `_collectionParams` mapping which stores `quorumVotes` & `availableClaim` that are used while claiming the ETH. As result, users will not or will receive 0 ETH in claim()
```solidity
function claim(address _collection, address payable _claimant) public nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
...
        // Get the number of votes from the claimant and the total supply and determine from that the percentage
        // of the available funds that they are able to claim.
@>      uint amount = params.availableClaim * claimableVotes / (params.quorumVotes * ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT / SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT);
        (bool sent,) = _claimant.call{value: amount}('');
        if (!sent) revert FailedToClaim();
...
    }
```

## Impact
Users will lose their share of ETH

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add this check in cancel() & vote()
```diff
+   if (params.sweeperPool != address(0)) revert ShutdownExecuted();
```
