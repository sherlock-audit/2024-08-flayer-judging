# No function for voters to reclaim their collectionTokens incase the shutdown process was canceled before being executed.

## Summary
Protocol supports cancelation of shutdown process, but fails to return the `collectionTokens` to the voters who already sent the tokens to the contract as a vote. 

There is a `reclaimVote` function for voters to unvote, but if voters tries to use this to reclaim collectionTokens incase the shutdown process was canceled, it will revert because the `_collectionParams` is already deleted. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Suppose 4 users vote to shutdown a collection, but there was a new deposit and cancel was triggered for the given collection;
```javascript
    function cancel(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
        // Ensure that the vote count has reached quorum
        CollectionShutdownParams memory params = _collectionParams[_collection];
        if (!params.canExecute) revert ShutdownNotReachedQuorum();

        // Check if the total supply has surpassed an amount of the initial required
        // total supply. This would indicate that a collection has grown since the
        // initial shutdown was triggered and could result in an unsuspected liquidation.
        if (params.collectionToken.totalSupply() <= MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS * 10 ** locker.collectionToken(_collection).denomination()) {
            revert InsufficientTotalSupplyToCancel();
        }

        // Remove our execution flag
        delete _collectionParams[_collection];
        emit CollectionShutdownCancelled(_collection);
    }
```
But what happens to those voters who voted 4e18 collectionTokens? 
There is not function for them to claim back their collateralTokens.

The [`reclaimVote`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L356-L377) function is not for this purpose, but still even if they try to use , it will also revert because;  
as we can see in the [`cancel`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L390-L405) function it already deletes the `_collectionParams[_collection]`, 
and therefore `reclaimVote` will revert in the line [`params.shutdownVotes -= uint96(userVotes);`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L369C9-L369C50) because the [`params.shutdownVotes`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L359) is 0. 

## Impact
Voters will not be able to claim back their collectionTokens and hence their nfts are also locked. 
It also doesn't need a malicious intention for this to happen, this can also happen in a very normal situation.

## Code Snippet
```javascript
    function cancel(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
        // Ensure that the vote count has reached quorum
        CollectionShutdownParams memory params = _collectionParams[_collection];
        if (!params.canExecute) revert ShutdownNotReachedQuorum();

        // Check if the total supply has surpassed an amount of the initial required
        // total supply. This would indicate that a collection has grown since the
        // initial shutdown was triggered and could result in an unsuspected liquidation.
        if (params.collectionToken.totalSupply() <= MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS * 10 ** locker.collectionToken(_collection).denomination()) {
            revert InsufficientTotalSupplyToCancel();
        }

        // Remove our execution flag
        delete _collectionParams[_collection];
        emit CollectionShutdownCancelled(_collection);
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Introduce a new mapping to keep track of canceled collections and a function for voters to reclaim their collateralTokens;

```javascript
    mapping (address _collection => bool) public wasCollectionCanceled;
    
    function reclaimVotesIfCanceled(address _collection) external {
        if(!wasCollectionCanceled[_collection]) revert collectionNotCanceled();

        uint userVotes = shutdownVoters[_collection][msg.sender];
        if (userVotes == 0) revert NoVotesPlacedYet();

        delete shutdownVoters[_collection][msg.sender];

        params.collectionToken.transfer(msg.sender, userVotes);
    }

```

Also set the `wasCollectionCanceled` to true after a collection has been canceled;
```diff
    function cancel(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
        // Ensure that the vote count has reached quorum
        CollectionShutdownParams memory params = _collectionParams[_collection];
        if (!params.canExecute) revert ShutdownNotReachedQuorum();

        // Check if the total supply has surpassed an amount of the initial required
        // total supply. This would indicate that a collection has grown since the
        // initial shutdown was triggered and could result in an unsuspected liquidation.
        if (params.collectionToken.totalSupply() <= MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS * 10 ** locker.collectionToken(_collection).denomination()) {
            revert InsufficientTotalSupplyToCancel();
        }

        // Remove our execution flag
        delete _collectionParams[_collection];

+       wasCollectionCanceled[_collection] = true;
        emit CollectionShutdownCancelled(_collection);
    }
```
