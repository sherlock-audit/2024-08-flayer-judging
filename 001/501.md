# It's possible to DOS a shutdown process by minting/burning collection tokens atomically

### Summary

_No response_

### Root Cause

[CollectionShutdown::cancel()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L390) can be called at any point by users that have at least 4 NFTs of the relative collection by:

1. Depositing the 4 NFTs in the locker via [Locker::deposit()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol) in order to mint `4e18` tokens
2. Calling [CollectionShutdown::cancel()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L390), which is now callable because the total supply of tokens is greater than `4e18`
3. Redeeming the 4 NFTs from the locker via [Locker::redeem()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L209)

Doing this it's possible to DOS a collection shutdown, preventing the NFTs locked in the protocol from being sold for ETH and then distributed to collection token holders.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. An attacker has 4 NFTs of a collection that's being shutdown

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Cancelling a shutdown process results in the protocol not selling the remaning collection NFTs for ETH and collection token holders not receiving any proceed. Another shutdown can be started via [CollectionShutdown::start()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L135), but this would require users to vote again.
