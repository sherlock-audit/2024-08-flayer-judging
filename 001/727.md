# Unable to reclaim votes after collection shutdown cancellation

## Summary

When a collection shutdown is canceled, the previous voter is unable to reclaim their vote due to the cancellation logic deleting the entire `_collectionParams` mapping. This results in inconsistent values and potential issues when the token returns to a shutdown state.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [`CollectionShutdown::cancel()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L390-L405) function deletes the `_collectionParams` mapping for a collection, which can lead to several problems:

[CollectionShutdown::cancel()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L390-L405)
```solidity
File: CollectionShutdown.sol
390:     function cancel(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
391:         // Ensure that the vote count has reached quorum
392:         CollectionShutdownParams memory params = _collectionParams[_collection];
393:         if (!params.canExecute) revert ShutdownNotReachedQuorum();
394: 
395:         // Check if the total supply has surpassed an amount of the initial required
396:         // total supply. This would indicate that a collection has grown since the
397:         // initial shutdown was triggered and could result in an unsuspected liquidation.
398:         if (params.collectionToken.totalSupply() <= MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS * 10 ** locker.collectionToken(_collection).denomination()) {
399:             revert InsufficientTotalSupplyToCancel();
400:         }
401: 
402:         // Remove our execution flag
403:         delete _collectionParams[_collection];
404:         emit CollectionShutdownCancelled(_collection);
405:     }
```

This issue can prevent users from reclaiming their votes due to an underflow error:

[CollectionShutdown::reclaimVote()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L356-L377)
```solidity
File: CollectionShutdown.sol
356:     function reclaimVote(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
---
368:         // We delete the votes that the user has attributed to the collection
369:@>       params.shutdownVotes -= uint96(userVotes);
---
377:     }
```
Moreover, this can lead to inconsistencies in the shutdown state of collections:

Assuming:

* Before cancellation, `totalSupply` was `400` and `shutdownVotes` was `200` (allowing the collection shutdown to proceed). If the `totalSupply` then increases due to other actions, making cancellation possible, the process resets all parameters and `shutdownVotes` to zero.
* When users attempt to reclaim their votes after cancellation, they may encounter underflow errors because their previous votes are no longer tracked.
* If the collection becomes eligible for shutdown again, `shutdownVotes` will incorrectly reflect zero previous votes, resulting in some supply being locked without proper voting power accounting.

## Impact

Prevents users from reclaiming their votes due to underflow revert and results in inconsistencies in the shutdown state.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Modify the `CollectionShutdown::cancel()` function to preserve the `shutdownVotes` data. When restarting the collection shutdown process, ensure that `shutdownVotes` is not zero, which implies that this parameter is used to track **each-time** when a shutdown collection is started. 

[CollectionShutdown::start()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L135-L157)
```solidity
File: CollectionShutdown.sol
135:     function start(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
136:         // Confirm that this collection is not prevented from being shutdown
137:         if (shutdownPrevented[_collection]) revert ShutdownPrevented();
138: 
139:         // Ensure that a shutdown process is not already actioned
140:         CollectionShutdownParams memory params = _collectionParams[_collection];
141:@>       if (params.shutdownVotes != 0) revert ShutdownProcessAlreadyStarted();
---
157:     }
```
This may necessitate additional variables or mechanisms to correctly track and handle cancellations and votes throughout the lifecycle of the shutdown process.

```diff
+ mapping(address _collection => uint96 unclaimedVote) public unclaimedVotes;
---
function cancel(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
    // Ensure that the vote count has reached quorum
    CollectionShutdownParams memory params = _collectionParams[_collection];
    if (!params.canExecute) revert ShutdownNotReachedQuorum();

    // Check if the total supply has surpassed an amount of the initial required
    // total supply. This would indicate that a collection has grown since the
    // initial shutdown was triggered and could result in an unsuspected liquidation.
    if (params.collectionToken.totalSupply() <= MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS * 10 ** locker.collectionToken(_collection).denomination()) {
        revert InsufficientTotalSupplyToCancel();
    }

+   unclaimedVotes[_collection] = params.shutdownVotes;
    // Remove our execution flag
    delete _collectionParams[_collection];
    emit CollectionShutdownCancelled(_collection);
}
```

```diff
+ mapping(address _collection => uint96 unclaimedVote) public unclaimedVotes;
---
function _vote(address _collection, CollectionShutdownParams memory params) internal returns (CollectionShutdownParams memory) {
    // Take tokens from the user and hold them in this escrow contract
    uint userVotes = params.collectionToken.balanceOf(msg.sender);
    if (userVotes == 0) revert UserHoldsNoTokens();

    // Pull our tokens in from the user
    params.collectionToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), userVotes);

    // Register the amount of votes sent as a whole, and store them against the user
    params.shutdownVotes += uint96(userVotes);
+   if (unclaimedVotes[_collection] != 0) { // Settle the unclaimed
+       params.shutdownVotes += unclaimedVotes[_collection];
+       unclaimedVotes[_collection] = 0;
+   }

    // Register the amount of votes for the collection against the user
    unchecked { shutdownVoters[_collection][msg.sender] += userVotes; }

    emit CollectionShutdownVote(_collection, msg.sender, userVotes);

    // If we can execute, then we need to fire another event
    if (!params.canExecute && params.shutdownVotes >= params.quorumVotes) {
        params.canExecute = true;
        emit CollectionShutdownQuorumReached(_collection);
    }

    return params;
}
---
function reclaimVote(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
    // If the quorum has passed, then we can no longer reclaim as we are pending
    // an execution.
    CollectionShutdownParams storage params = _collectionParams[_collection];
    if (params.canExecute) revert ShutdownQuorumHasPassed();
+   if (params.sweeperPool != address(0)) revert ShutdownExecuted(); // prevent from reclaim after executed

    // Get the amount of votes that the user has cast for this collection
    uint userVotes = shutdownVoters[_collection][msg.sender];

    // If the user has not cast a vote, then we can revert early
    if (userVotes == 0) revert NoVotesPlacedYet();

    // We delete the votes that the user has attributed to the collection
-   params.shutdownVotes -= uint96(userVotes);
+   params.shutdownVotes != 0 ? params.shutdownVotes -= uint96(userVotes) : unclaimedVotes[_collection] -= uint96(userVotes); // Imply that if no `shutdownVotes` it is move to unclaimedVotes and not yet start again
    delete shutdownVoters[_collection][msg.sender];

    // We can now return their tokens
    params.collectionToken.transfer(msg.sender, userVotes);

    // Notify our stalkers that a vote has been reclaimed
    emit CollectionShutdownVoteReclaim(_collection, msg.sender, userVotes);
}
