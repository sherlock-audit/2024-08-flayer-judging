# An attacker can block the execution of CollectionShutdown.execute




## Summary
An attacker can block the execution of CollectionShutdown.execute, and cause `Shutdown` to fail.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `execute` function checks if the collection has a `list` in progress and then executes shutdown:

```solidity
    function execute(address _collection, uint[] calldata _tokenIds) public onlyOwner whenNotPaused {
        // Ensure that the vote count has reached quorum
        CollectionShutdownParams storage params = _collectionParams[_collection];
        if (!params.canExecute) revert ShutdownNotReachedQuorum();

        // Ensure we have specified token IDs
        uint _tokenIdsLength = _tokenIds.length;
        if (_tokenIdsLength == 0) revert NoNFTsSupplied();

        // Check that no listings currently exist
        if (_hasListings(_collection)) revert ListingsExist();
        .....
    }
    
    function _hasListings(address _collection) internal view returns (bool) {
        IListings listings = locker.listings();
        if (address(listings) != address(0)) {
            if (listings.listingCount(_collection) != 0) {
                return true;
            }

            // Check that no protected listings currently exist
            IProtectedListings protectedListings = listings.protectedListings();
            if (address(protectedListings) != address(0)) {
                if (protectedListings.listingCount(_collection) != 0) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }

        return false;
    }

```

The problem is that an attacker can create a list before execute is executed, so execute can never be executed.

When execute can be executed (params.canExecute = ture), the user's vote has already been cast, and the vote passed.

When a vote is taken, the `collectionToken` is transferred to the current contract, so if `Shutdown` cannot be executed, the `collectionToken` is locked in the current `Shutdown` contract.

```solidity
    function _vote(address _collection, CollectionShutdownParams memory params) internal returns (CollectionShutdownParams memory) {
        // Take tokens from the user and hold them in this escrow contract
        uint userVotes = params.collectionToken.balanceOf(msg.sender);
        if (userVotes == 0) revert UserHoldsNoTokens();
        // Pull our tokens in from the user
@>      params.collectionToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), userVotes);
        ......
        return params;
    }
```

At this point, the user also cannot `reclaimVote`, because `params.canExecute` is ture:

```solidity    
    function reclaimVote(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
        // If the quorum has passed, then we can no longer reclaim as we are pending
        // an execution.
        CollectionShutdownParams storage params = _collectionParams[_collection];
@>      if (params.canExecute) revert ShutdownQuorumHasPassed();
        .....
    }
```

## Impact
CollectionShutdown.execute cannot be executed. As a result, Shutdown fails and users cannot claim tokens.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
After Shutdown, users are not allowed to create lists.
