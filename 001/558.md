# Protected listing allows to adjust their token taken amount even if their listing is liquidatable

## Summary
Impact: borrowing the liquidity(collection token) forever. Also allowing them to adjust their debt while prone is liquidation is against the lending/protected listing norms.
Root cause: weak validation of the current debt.

## Vulnerability Detail
Listers who listed as protected listing can adjust their listing's token taken amount that determines their listing health.
But adjusting is possible even if the listing is currently liquidatable meaning `getProtectedListingHealth` will return  < 0. 
Mostly in lending protocols, if their debt is liquidatable, then the borrowers are not allowed to (repay interest/decrease their borrowed amount/ increase collateral ).

But here, in the protected listing, the listers can change their token taken amount even if their listing is currently liquidatble. It's a missing validation. Just check if the debt is always > 0 before adjusting their token taken amounts.

```solidity
    function adjustPosition(address _collection, uint _tokenId, int _amount) public lockerNotPaused {
    ---- SNIP ----

        // Get the current debt of the position
 >>>    int debt = getProtectedListingHealth(_collection, _tokenId);

    ---- SNIP ----


        // Check if we are decreasing debt
        if (_amount < 0) {
            if (debt + int(absAmount) >= int(MAX_PROTECTED_TOKEN_AMOUNT)) revert IncorrectFunctionUse();
    ---- SNIP ----

            _protectedListings[_collection][_tokenId].tokenTaken -= uint96(absAmount);
        }
        // Otherwise, the user is increasing their debt to take more token
        else {
            if (_amount > debt) revert InsufficientCollateral();
    ---- SNIP ----

            // Update the struct to reflect the new tokenTaken, protecting from overflow
            _protectedListings[_collection][_tokenId].tokenTaken += uint96(absAmount);
        }

        emit ListingDebtAdjusted(_collection, _tokenId, _amount);
    }
