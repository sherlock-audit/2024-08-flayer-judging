# `ProtectedListings::_createCheckpoint()` incorrectly updates the `compoundedFactor` instead of the utilization ratio which will lead to incorrect interest calculations and losses/wins for users

### Summary

[ProtectedListings::_createCheckpoint()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L530) replaces the previous checkpoint information if it is the same block (as no time has passed, the compound factor will not increase). In the process, it should update the utilization rate, as this affects the next compounded factor calculation.

### Root Cause

In `ProtectedListings:565`, the `compoundedFactor` is updated instead of the utilization rate.

### Internal pre-conditions

2 calls that modify the utilization rate (`ProtectedListings::createListings()` for example) in the same block.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Users call `ProtectedListings::createListings()` in the same block, for example. This will not update the interest rate to the highest after the second `ProtectedListings::createListings()` call.

### Impact

Users take losses or exploit this fact for their advantage due to wrong utilization rate update.

### PoC

```solidity
// If no time has passed in our new checkpoint, then we just need to update the
// utilization rate of the existing checkpoint.
if (checkpoint.timestamp == collectionCheckpoints[_collection][index_ - 1].timestamp) {
    collectionCheckpoints[_collection][index_ - 1].compoundedFactor = checkpoint.compoundedFactor; //@audit is updating the compoundedFactor instead of the utilizationRate
    return index_;
}
```

### Mitigation

Update the utilization rate instead.
