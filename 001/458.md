# Locker actions affecting utilization rate are not checkpointed

### Summary

Utilization rate is not checkpointed at all times when necessary as depositing, redeeming and unbacked depositing to the Locker, for example, will affect the CT total supply while **not** affecting the collection's protected listings count and thus this will affect the utilization rate on which interest rates and liquidations rely on.


### Root Cause

Some functions of the **Locker** contract that alter the CollectionTokens' `totalSupply` do **not** checkpoint the collection's `compoundedFactor` which enables certain vulnerabilities outlined in the **Impact** section.

1. [**Locker**#`deposit()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L144-L166)
```solidity
    function deposit(address _collection, uint[] calldata _tokenIds, address _recipient) public
        nonReentrant
        whenNotPaused
        collectionExists(_collection)
    {
        uint tokenIdsLength = _tokenIds.length;
        if (tokenIdsLength == 0) revert NoTokenIds();

        // Define our collection token outside the loop
        IERC721 collection = IERC721(_collection);

        // Take the ERC721 tokens from the caller
        for (uint i; i < tokenIdsLength; ++i) {
            // Transfer the collection token from the caller to the locker
            collection.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _tokenIds[i]);
        }

        // Mint the tokens to the recipient
        ICollectionToken token = _collectionToken[_collection];
→       token.mint(_recipient, tokenIdsLength * 1 ether * 10 ** token.denomination());

        emit TokenDeposit(_collection, _tokenIds, msg.sender, _recipient);
    }
```

2. [**Locker**#`unbackedDeposit()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L179-L188)
```solidity
    function unbackedDeposit(address _collection, uint _amount) public nonReentrant whenNotPaused collectionExists(_collection) {
        // Ensure that our caller is an approved manager
        if (!lockerManager.isManager(msg.sender)) revert UnapprovedCaller();

        // Ensure that the collection has not been initialized
        if (collectionInitialized[_collection]) revert CollectionAlreadyInitialized();

        // Mint the {CollectionToken} to the sender
→       _collectionToken[_collection].mint(msg.sender, _amount);
    }
```

3. [**Locker**#`redeem()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L209-L230)
```solidity
    function redeem(address _collection, uint[] calldata _tokenIds, address _recipient) public nonReentrant whenNotPaused collectionExists(_collection) {
        uint tokenIdsLength = _tokenIds.length;
        if (tokenIdsLength == 0) revert NoTokenIds();

        // Burn the ERC20 tokens from the caller
        ICollectionToken collectionToken_ = _collectionToken[_collection];
→       collectionToken_.burnFrom(msg.sender, tokenIdsLength * 1 ether * 10 ** collectionToken_.denomination());

        // Define our collection token outside the loop
        IERC721 collection = IERC721(_collection);

        // Loop through the tokenIds and redeem them
        for (uint i; i < tokenIdsLength; ++i) {
            // Ensure that the token requested is not a listing
            if (isListing(_collection, _tokenIds[i])) revert TokenIsListing(_tokenIds[i]);

            // Transfer the collection token to the caller
            collection.transferFrom(address(this), _recipient, _tokenIds[i]);
        }

        emit TokenRedeem(_collection, _tokenIds, msg.sender, _recipient);
    }
```

This becomes exploitable due to the way `unlockPrice()` and `getProtectedListingHealth()` measure the increase in compound factor. When a protected listing (a loan) is recorded, the current collection `compoundFactor` is checkpointed and its index is stored in the Listing struct as `checkpoint`.  Now when it comes to `getProtectedListingHealth()` lets see how it works:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L497-L501
```solidity
    function getProtectedListingHealth(address _collection, uint _tokenId) public view listingExists(_collection, _tokenId) returns (int) {
        // ...
→       return int(MAX_PROTECTED_TOKEN_AMOUNT) - int(unlockPrice(_collection, _tokenId));
    }
```

The `MAX_PROTECTED_TOKEN_AMOUNT` constant is equal to $0.95e18$.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L607-L617
```solidity
    function unlockPrice(address _collection, uint _tokenId) public view returns (uint unlockPrice_) {
        // ...
        unlockPrice_ = locker.taxCalculator().compound({
            _principle: listing.tokenTaken,
            _initialCheckpoint: collectionCheckpoints[_collection][listing.checkpoint],
→           _currentCheckpoint: _currentCheckpoint(_collection)
        });
    }
```

**TaxCalculator**#`compound()` simply takes the listing's `tokenTaken` and multiplies it by `_currentCheckpoint.compoundedFactor / _initialCheckpoint.compoundedFactor` in a typical rebase token fashion (for example).

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L580-L596
```solidity
    function _currentCheckpoint(address _collection) internal view returns (Checkpoint memory checkpoint_) {
        // Calculate the current interest rate based on utilization
→       (, uint _utilizationRate) = utilizationRate(_collection);

        // Update the compounded factor with the new interest rate and time period
        Checkpoint memory previousCheckpoint = collectionCheckpoints[_collection][collectionCheckpoints[_collection].length - 1];

        // Save the new checkpoint
        checkpoint_ = Checkpoint({
→           compoundedFactor: locker.taxCalculator().calculateCompoundedFactor({
                _previousCompoundedFactor: previousCheckpoint.compoundedFactor,
                _utilizationRate: _utilizationRate,
                _timePeriod: block.timestamp - previousCheckpoint.timestamp
            }),
            timestamp: block.timestamp
        });
    }
```

Now we've come to the essence of the problem. `_currentCheckpoint()` fetches the **current** `utilizationRate` to calculate the new `compoundedFactor` for the current `block.timestamp` checkpoint which fetches the current CollectionToken `totalSupply()` and the collection's protected listings count. And an attacker can manipulate the former (`totalSupply`) without making the latter change and thus influence the utilization rate of a collection in the direction they wish.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L261-L276
```solidity
    function utilizationRate(address _collection) public view virtual returns (uint listingsOfType_, uint utilizationRate_) {
        // Get the count of active listings of the specified listing type
        listingsOfType_ = listingCount[_collection];

        // If we have listings of this type then we need to calculate the percentage, otherwise
        // we will just return a zero percent value.
        if (listingsOfType_ != 0) {
            ICollectionToken collectionToken = locker.collectionToken(_collection);

            // If we have no totalSupply, then we have a zero percent utilization
→           uint totalSupply = collectionToken.totalSupply();
            if (totalSupply != 0) {
→               utilizationRate_ = (listingsOfType_ * 1e36 * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination()) / totalSupply;
            }
        }
    }
```

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

A few attack vectors stemming from this absence of checkpointing in the functions mentioned above include:

1. You can deposit/redeem from Locker to bring down the utilization rate to, for example, avoid being liquidated as your listing health is calculated as `0.95e18 - tokenTaken * compoundedFactor increase since loan is taken`. 
2. You can redeem NFTs to bump up the utilization rate, take loans at a high compounded factor and when you want to repay or unlock, deposit these NFTs back so you soften the increase in compound factor.
3. You can grief other users by bumping up the utilization rate when they are unlocking or adjusting their position so they pay more interest as the interest rate is a function of the utilization rate.
4. You can worsen loans' health and cause otherwise healthy loans to be subject to liquidation.


### Impact

As outlined in the **Attack Path** section, the impact is quite substantial. The highest of all is griefing other users by forcing them to unexpectedly pay higher interest on their loans and make otherwise healthy loans become liquidateable.

Given the way utilization rate is calculated, we can see how each function that affects either a collection's CollectionToken total supply or the number of protected listings will affect the utilization rate of the collection:

$utilizationRate = \dfrac{collection\ protected\ listings\ count\ *\ 1e36\ *\ 10^{denomination}}{CT\ total\ supply}$

### PoC

See **Attack Path** and **Impact**.

### Mitigation

Simply checkpoint a collection's `compoundFactor` by calling **ProtectedListings**#`createCheckpoint()` at the end of the vulnerable functions.
