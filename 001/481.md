# Users vote will be locked in CollectionShutdown.sol if the collection is cancelled

## Summary
Users vote will be locked in CollectionShutdown.sol if the collection is cancelled

## Vulnerability Detail
Users should reclaim their votes ie collectionToken, if collection is cancelled. But they can't due to arithmetic underflow.

When a user votes, its vote get stored in `shutdownVotes` of _collectionParams mapping. But the problem is when a collection is cancelled, it deletes the _collectionParams mapping. 
```solidity
function cancel(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
//
        // Remove our execution flag
>       delete _collectionParams[_collection];
        emit CollectionShutdownCancelled(_collection);
    }
```
So, when user try to reclaim their votes, it subtracts their votes from `shutdownVotes`(which is 0 because cancel() deletes the _collectionParams mapping)
```solidity
function reclaimVote(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
//
        // Get the amount of votes that the user has cast for this collection
        uint userVotes = shutdownVoters[_collection][msg.sender];

        // If the user has not cast a vote, then we can revert early
        if (userVotes == 0) revert NoVotesPlacedYet();

        // We delete the votes that the user has attributed to the collection
>       params.shutdownVotes -= uint96(userVotes);
        delete shutdownVoters[_collection][msg.sender];
//
    }
```

## Impact
reclaimVotes() will revert, locking users collectionToken in the contract

## Recommendation
Instead of deleting whole _collectionParams mapping in cancel(), delete it in reclaimVotes()
