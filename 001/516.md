# `ProtectedListings::createListings()` creates checkpoint before `listingCount` variable is updated

### Summary

_No response_

### Root Cause

[ProtectedListings::createListings()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L117) creates a new checkpoint before the `listingCount` variable is updated and new tokens are minted:

```solidity
checkpointKey = keccak256(abi.encodePacked('checkpointIndex', listing.collection));
assembly { checkpointIndex := tload(checkpointKey) }
if (checkpointIndex == 0) {
    checkpointIndex = _createCheckpoint(listing.collection);
    assembly { tstore(checkpointKey, checkpointIndex) }
}

...

unchecked {
    listingCount[listing.collection] += tokensIdsLength;
}

_depositNftsAndReceiveTokens(listing, tokensReceived)
```

This is problematic because the interest rate calculation on checkpoints depends on the `listingCount` variable and the total supply of collection tokens.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

The utilization rate is calculated as follows:

```solidity
uint256 utilizationRate_ = (listingsOfType_ * 1e36 * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination()) / totalSupply;

uint256 interestRate_ = 200 + (_utilizationRate * 600) / UTILIZATION_KINK; //UTILIZATION_KINK = 0.8e18
```

1. Eve wants to create 10 protected listings, she calls [ProtectedListings::createListings()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L117). The collection has currently no protected listings, meaning it's utilization rate is `0` and the interest rate is the minimum, `200 = 2%`.
2. Eve will pay `2%` interest rate on all of her protected listings, but because 10 new listings are created she should pay, asssuming `2e19` total supply, an interest rate of `575 = 5.75%`

### Impact

Users that create protected listings will pay less interest rate than they should, which is a loss of funds for users that provide liquidity in the UniswapV4 pool.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Create the checkpoint after the new tokens are minted and the amount of listings updated.
