# Users' voting token in CollectionShutdown will be locked when we cancel this shutdown flow

## Summary
When we cancel one shutdown flow, users' voting tokens will be locked in the shutdown contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
If one collection market is not active, we call trigger one shutdown flow to shutdown this market. In the process of voting, we can cancel this shutdown flow if the market becomes active.
The problem is that `_collectionParams` is cleared when we cancel this collection's shutdown flow. If voters want to reclaim their votes, this will be reverted because `params.shutdownVotes` is zero.
The voters cannot get back their voting tokens and also cannot execute this shutdown flow to claim some rewards.

```solidity
    function cancel(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
        CollectionShutdownParams memory params = _collectionParams[_collection];
        if (!params.canExecute) revert ShutdownNotReachedQuorum();
        if (params.collectionToken.totalSupply() <= MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS * 10 ** locker.collectionToken(_collection).denomination()) {
            revert InsufficientTotalSupplyToCancel();
        }

@>        delete _collectionParams[_collection]; // Note , here the canExecute is reset to false.
        emit CollectionShutdownCancelled(_collection);
    }
```
```solidity
    function reclaimVote(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
@>        CollectionShutdownParams storage params = _collectionParams[_collection];
        if (params.canExecute) revert ShutdownQuorumHasPassed();

        uint userVotes = shutdownVoters[_collection][msg.sender];

        if (userVotes == 0) revert NoVotesPlacedYet();

@>        params.shutdownVotes -= uint96(userVotes);
        delete shutdownVoters[_collection][msg.sender];

        params.collectionToken.transfer(msg.sender, userVotes);

        // Notify our stalkers that a vote has been reclaimed
        emit CollectionShutdownVoteReclaim(_collection, msg.sender, userVotes);
    }
```
## Impact
The voters cannot get back their voting tokens and also cannot execute this shutdown flow to claim some rewards.

## Recommendation
When we cancel one shutdown flow, do not reset the `shutdownVotes`. Then the voters can reclaim their votes.
