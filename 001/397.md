# Users can fully repay their token taken amount by calling adjust listing, instead of calling unlock listing.

## Summary
Impact: Breaking the core invariant of the listing contract.
Root cause: insufficient validation. Just check if the token taken should be > 0 before the end of the adjust listing function.

## Vulnerability Detail

`The user should not be fully repaying the debt in this way. For this scenario, the owner would instead use the unlockProtectedListing function`

Line 379 is an invariant saying that the user should never be able to completely repay the token taken. Bu the current validation on line 379 is not sufficient, a user can completely repay his token taken.

Issue  flow :
1. User lists BAYC 200 as protected and token taken is 0.5 ether.
2. after 10 days, the unlock price becomes 0.55 ether (10% tax for 10 days), so 0.05 ether tax is incurred.
3. Now user calls `adjustPosition` with +0.5 ether as `_amount` parameter.
4. Since the `debt`= 0.95 - 0.55(unlock price) = 0.40 ether, inside the if block on line 378 will pass, 0.40 + 0.5 is < 0.95
5. On line 392, the token taken is reduced from 0.5 to 0 ( 0.5 - 0.5) by pulling 0.5 ether of tokens from user. 

Then the user can call unlock protected listing, where his health with 0.95 ether and the `_principle` will be 0 because the token taken is 0. So, he can unlock his token for free without any token taken payment and get his NFT back.

383:                 msg.sender,
384:                 address(this),
385:                 absAmount * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination()
386:             );
387: 
393:             _protectedListings[_collection][_tokenId].tokenTaken -= uint96(absAmount);
394:         }
395:         // Otherwise, the user is increasing their debt to take more token
396:         else {
397:                 ---- SNIP ----
414:         }
415: 
416:         emit ListingDebtAdjusted(_collection, _tokenId, _amount);
417:     }

```


## Impact
Users should not be able to repay their whole token taken amount on an adjust listing call. But they can do it, breaking the invariant.
