# Users can create permanent protected listings and inflate interest rates

## Summary
User can create permanently protected listings which influence utilization and interest rates
## Vulnerability Detail
Steps to produce:  
1) User invokes `ProtectedListings.createListing` with, for example, `tokenTaken` = 0.90e18 and `collateral` = 0.10e18
2) Some time passes and user accrues some negligible interest, not enough to put them for liquidation (e.g 0.01e18)
3) User invokes `adjustPosition` with `_amount = -0.90e18` in order to repay their `tokenTaken`
4) This method will pass as per the snippet below
```solidity

        int debt = getProtectedListingHealth(_collection, _tokenId); // 0.95e18 - 0.91e18 = 0.04e18

        uint absAmount = uint(_amount < 0 ? -_amount : _amount);     // 0.90e18 

        ICollectionToken collectionToken = locker.collectionToken(_collection);

        if (_amount < 0) {

            if (debt + int(absAmount) >= int(MAX_PROTECTED_TOKEN_AMOUNT)) revert IncorrectFunctionUse();  // 0.04e18 + 0.90e18 >= 0.95e18 -> pass

            collectionToken.transferFrom(                                                                 // sends tokens
                msg.sender,
                address(this),
                absAmount * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination()
            );


            // Update the struct to reflect the new tokenTaken, protecting from overflow
            _protectedListings[_collection][_tokenId].tokenTaken -= uint96(absAmount);                    // @audit becomes 0 since tokenTaken = absAmount
        }
```
User now has a non-liquidatable protected listing due to `getProtectedListingHealth` always returning 0.95e18

```solidity
    function getProtectedListingHealth(address _collection, uint _tokenId) public view listingExists(_collection, _tokenId) returns (int) {

        return int(MAX_PROTECTED_TOKEN_AMOUNT) - int(unlockPrice(_collection, _tokenId)); // @note unlockPrice is always 0 since tokenTaken is also 0
    }
```
Malicious users can abuse this as each protected listing in circulation increases the utilization rate which is based on `listingCount`. This comes at no expense of attacker since they can always invoke `unlockProtectedListing` and redeem their NFT at no cost since the fee during unlock is also based on `unlockPrice` which as stated above is now 0.

```solidity
        uint fee = unlockPrice(_collection, _tokenId) * 10 ** denomination;
        collectionToken.burnFrom(msg.sender, fee);
```
Attack will become more detrimental as the utilization rate approaches the utilization kink where interest rates jump tremendously which will either charge honest users artificially increased interest rates or discourage them from interacting with the protocol.

## Impact
Artificial interest inflation at no cost 
## Code Snippet
[`adjustPosition`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L366)
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
During `adjustPosition`, whenever `tokenTaken` becomes 0, employ the last part of `unlockProtectedListing` where the listing is deleted and store `canWithdrawAsset[_collection][_tokenId] = msg.sender`
```solidity
        unchecked { --listingCount[_collection]; }

        delete _protectedListings[_collection][_tokenId];

            canWithdrawAsset[_collection][_tokenId] = msg.sender;
        
```
