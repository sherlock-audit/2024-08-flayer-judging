# Borrowers can avoid paying borrowing interest via adjustPosition

## Summary
Borrowers can repay the principle via `adjustPosition` and avoid paying borrowing interest fees.

## Vulnerability Detail
When users create one protected listing, the borrowing interest fee starts to accure. Users can adjust their borrowing position via `adjustPosition`.
The problem is that all repaid amount will be decreased from the `tokenTaken` and `tokenTaken` is this borrowing position's principle. So borrowers can repay their principles to decrease `tokenTaken` to zero and unlock to get back their ERC721 tokens.

For example:
1. Alice creates one protected position, with `tokenTaken = 0.4 ether`. Then the initial left collateral is 0.55 ether.
2. After a long period, the borrowing interest fee increases from 0 to 0.4 ether. Now the left collateral is 0.15 ether.
3. Alice adjust position via repaying 0.4 ether. This will decrease her borrowing principle to 0.
4. Alice can unlock her protected position without any extra borrowing fees.

```solidity
    function adjustPosition(address _collection, uint _tokenId, int _amount) public lockerNotPaused {
        ...
        // Get the current debt of the position, this is not the debt, this is the left collateral.
        // Note, here we've already decrease the borrowing interest.
        int debt = getProtectedListingHealth(_collection, _tokenId);
        // Calculate the absolute value of our amount
        uint absAmount = uint(_amount < 0 ? -_amount : _amount);
        // cache
        ICollectionToken collectionToken = locker.collectionToken(_collection);

        // Check if we are decreasing debt
        if (_amount < 0) {
            if (debt + int(absAmount) >= int(MAX_PROTECTED_TOKEN_AMOUNT)) revert IncorrectFunctionUse();

            // Take tokens from the caller
            collectionToken.transferFrom(
                msg.sender,
                address(this),
                absAmount * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination()
            );
@>            _protectedListings[_collection][_tokenId].tokenTaken -= uint96(absAmount);
        }
        ...
}
```

## Impact
Borrowers can avoid paying the borrowing fee via `adjustPosition`

## Recommendation
We need to do some refactor for this part. The repay part should include borrow principle and the borrowing interest. Borrowers can assign how much principle they want to repay. The actual repay amount should be calculated via compound factor.
