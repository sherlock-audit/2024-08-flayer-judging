# `relist()` doesn't check if the listing is` liquidationLisiting` or not, paying unnecessary tax to the owner

## Summary
`relist()` doesn't check if the listing is` liquidationLisiting` or not, paying unnecessary tax to the owner

## Vulnerability Detail
When a `liquidationListing` is listed then it doesn't pay `tax` amount. As result, it shouldn't be given `taxRefunds`. 

But the problem is in `relist()`, it doesn't check if the listing is liquidationListing or not, successfully paying owner of the liquidationLisiting tax amount, which he didn't paid while listing.
```solidity
function relist(CreateListing calldata _listing, bool _payTaxWithEscrow) public nonReentrant lockerNotPaused {
//
        // We can process a tax refund for the existing listing
>       (uint _fees,) = _resolveListingTax(oldListing, _collection, true);
        if (_fees != 0) {
            emit ListingFeeCaptured(_collection, _tokenId, _fees);
        }
//
    }
```

## Impact
Owner will receive tax refunds which he didn't paid

## Recommendation
Before sending tax refunds, ensure its not liquidationListing
```solidity
 if (!_isLiquidation[_collection][_tokenId]) {
                (uint _fees,) = _resolveListingTax(oldListing, _collection, true);
                if (_fees != 0) {
                    emit ListingFeeCaptured(_collection, _tokenId, _fees);
                }
            }
```
