### Impact

Protected listings with collateral can be unlocked because the collateral check is wrong.

### PoC

The collateral check being used when unlocking protected listings is incorrect. 
[ProtectedListings.sol#L296](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L296)
```solidity
    function unlockProtectedListing(address _collection, uint _tokenId, bool _withdraw) public lockerNotPaused {
        // Ensure this is a protected listing
        ProtectedListing memory listing = _protectedListings[_collection][_tokenId];

        // Ensure the caller owns the listing
        if (listing.owner != msg.sender) revert CallerIsNotOwner(listing.owner);

        // Ensure that the protected listing has run out of collateral
        int collateral = getProtectedListingHealth(_collection, _tokenId);
        // @audit
@>      if (collateral < 0) revert InsufficientCollateral();
        ...
    }
```
The correct check is `if (collateral > 0)`.

### Mitigation

The protocol should correct the check this way to ensure that the listing has run out of collateral before unlocking the listing.

```solidity
    function unlockProtectedListing(address _collection, uint _tokenId, bool _withdraw) public lockerNotPaused {
        // Ensure this is a protected listing
        ProtectedListing memory listing = _protectedListings[_collection][_tokenId];

        // Ensure the caller owns the listing
        if (listing.owner != msg.sender) revert CallerIsNotOwner(listing.owner);

        // Ensure that the protected listing has run out of collateral
        int collateral = getProtectedListingHealth(_collection, _tokenId);
+       if (collateral > 0) revert listingHasCollateral();

    }
```
