# Protected listings can be closed for free

## Summary
Users with open protected listings can close them for free if they reduce their debt beforehand with `ProtectedListings.adjustPosition`
## Vulnerability Detail  
For the sake of simplicity, we assume that token denomination = 4 and floorPrice = 1e18 * 10^denomination = 1e22  

The flow of the `protectedListing` method is the following:
- user sends their NFT to `ProtectedListings.sol`
- `ProtectedListings.sol` invokes `deposit` in `Locker.sol` and receives 1e22 
- `ProtectedListings.sol` sends `tokenTaken` number of tokens to user and the rest is left as collateral
- Interest starts compounding on their `tokenTaken` and user's listing is healthy until `tokenTaken * compoundFactor > 0.95e18`

When user wants to unlock their NFT they invoke `unlockProtectedListing` and they have to pay a fee 
```solidity
        uint fee = unlockPrice(_collection, _tokenId) * 10 ** denomination;
```  
The `unlockPrice` method calculates the interest by multiplying `tokenTaken` by `compoundedFactor` which is the % increase between the compound factor at the time of listing creation and current one.

```solidity
        uint compoundedFactor = _currentCheckpoint.compoundedFactor * 1e18 / _initialCheckpoint.compoundedFactor;
        compoundAmount_ = _principle * compoundedFactor / 1e18; // @note principle = tokenTaken
```
However, users can invoke `adjustPosition` before `unlockProtectedListing` and repay `tokenTaken` without paying any interest, thus bringing it to 0 which will lead to `unlockPrice = 0`.  

Let's go through the following scenario:
- User creates protected listing with `tokenTaken = 0.8e18` and `collateral = 0.2e18` 
- Some time passes and user yields 0.1e22 in interest so `unlockPrice = 0.9e18`, user is still healthy
- User invokes `adjustPosition` with `_amount = -0.8e18` 
```solidity
        int debt = getProtectedListingHealth(_collection, _tokenId); // = 0.95e18 - 0.90e18 = 0.05e18

        uint absAmount = uint(_amount < 0 ? -_amount : _amount);    // = 0.8e18

        if (_amount < 0) {
            if (debt + int(absAmount) >= int(MAX_PROTECTED_TOKEN_AMOUNT)) revert IncorrectFunctionUse(); // if (0.05e18 + 0.80e18 >= 0.95e18) revert -> @audit does not revert, continues execution
        }
```
As we see from the snippet above, the checks pass, user sends 0.8e22 collection tokens and has their `tokenTaken` reduced to 0  

```solidity
            collectionToken.transferFrom(
                msg.sender,
                address(this),
                absAmount * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination()
            );


            // Update the struct to reflect the new tokenTaken, protecting from overflow
            _protectedListings[_collection][_tokenId].tokenTaken -= uint96(absAmount);
```
Since `tokenTaken` equals 0, user can invoke `unlockProtectedListing` and pay 0 in fees since `unlockPrice` method will return a 0.

Whenever users adjusts their position, make them pay a fee up to that point.
