# Users Lose Funds When Cancelling Collection Shutdown

## Summary
Users who voted to shut down the collection will lose funds when the `CollectionShutdown::cancel` function is called.

## Vulnerability Detail
When the `CollectionShutdown::cancel` function is executed, the `_collectionParams[_collection]` state variable is deleted. As a result, the value of `_collectionParams[_collection].shutdownVotes` is reset to 0. This leads to an underflow error when a user who voted to shut down the collection attempts to call the `CollectionShutdown::reclaimVote` function, causing the transaction to always revert.

[CollectionShutdown::cancel](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L390-L405) function
```Solidity
function cancel(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
    // Ensure that the vote count has reached quorum
    CollectionShutdownParams memory params = _collectionParams[_collection];
    if (!params.canExecute) revert ShutdownNotReachedQuorum();

    if (params.collectionToken.totalSupply() <= MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS * 10 ** locker.collectionToken(_collection).denomination()) {
        revert InsufficientTotalSupplyToCancel();
    }

    // Remove our execution flag
=>  delete _collectionParams[_collection];
    emit CollectionShutdownCancelled(_collection);
}
```

[CollectionShutdown::reclaimVote](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L356-L377) function
```Solidity
function reclaimVote(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
    ...
    // We delete the votes that the user has attributed to the collection
=>  params.shutdownVotes -= uint96(userVotes); // Revert due to Underflow error
    delete shutdownVoters[_collection][msg.sender];

    // We can now return their tokens
    params.collectionToken.transfer(msg.sender, userVotes);
    ...
}
```
## Impact
Users who voted to shut down the collection will lose their funds.
