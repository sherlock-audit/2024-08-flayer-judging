# Users can't reclaim votes due to arithmetic underflow if collection is cancelled

## Summary
Users can't reclaim votes due to arithmetic underflow if collection is cancelled

## Vulnerability Detail
User can reclaim their votes using `reclaimVote()`, which reduces the `shutdownVotes` by `userVotes`.
```solidity
function reclaimVote(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
        CollectionShutdownParams storage params = _collectionParams[_collection];
...
        // We delete the votes that the user has attributed to the collection
@>      params.shutdownVotes -= uint96(userVotes);
...
    }
```
Now the problem is, when a collection is cancelled using cancel(), it deletes the `_collectionParams` mapping which stores the `shutdownVotes`(from which userVotes are reduced in reclaimVote()). 
```solidity
 function cancel(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
...
        // Remove our execution flag
@>      delete _collectionParams[_collection];
        emit CollectionShutdownCancelled(_collection);
    }
```

As result, when user will try to reclaim their votes for a cancelled collection, it will revert due to arithmetic underflow because `params.shutdownVotes` will be 0(zero) after cancel()


## Impact
Users will not be able to reclaim their votes for a cancelled collection

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Don't delete the `_collectionParams` mapping in cancel(), instead delete it in reclaimVotes(), only if shutdownVotes = 0
