# `relist` does not set the create time of the listing, so the attacker can set the create time to the future.

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L665
In the `relist` function, users can pay the fee for the existing listing and reset the parameters. `_validateCreateListing` is called to check the listing before setting the parameters, but it does not check the created. Therefore, the attacker can set the created arbitrarily. For the attacker, setting it to the future will be more profitable, because for the same operation time (reserve, relist, cancelListings),  the attacker will pay less tax and listing price will be higher.

### Root Cause

In `Listings.sol:665`, there is no check or reset for the listing created.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. someone create a listing
2. attatck relist it with new parameters where created is a future time
3. when this listing is `reserve`ed or `relist`ed, the listing price will be higher

### Impact

Attacker can set the listing createTime to a future time, in order to reduce the tax and increase the listing price.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```solidity
listing.created = block.timestamp;
_listings[_collection][_tokenId] = listing;
```
