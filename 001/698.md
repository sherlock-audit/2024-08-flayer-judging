# `reserve()` doesn't deletes the `_isLiquidation` mapping, causing tax loss for owner in future

## Summary
`reserve()` doesn't deletes the `_isLiquidation` mapping, causing tax loss for owner in future

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user reserve() a tokenId, it doesn't deletes the `_isLiquidation` mapping. 
```solidity
    function reserve(address _collection, uint _tokenId, uint _collateral) public nonReentrant lockerNotPaused {
//
        // Check if the listing is a floor item and process additional logic if there
        // was an owner (meaning it was not floor, so liquid or dutch).
        if (oldListing.owner != address(0)) {
            // We can process a tax refund for the existing listing if it isn't a liquidation
            if (!_isLiquidation[_collection][_tokenId]) {
                (uint _fees,) = _resolveListingTax(oldListing, _collection, true);
                if (_fees != 0) {
                    emit ListingFeeCaptured(_collection, _tokenId, _fees);
                }
            }

            // If the floor multiple of the original listings is different, then this needs
            // to be paid to the original owner of the listing.
            uint listingFloorPrice = 1 ether * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination();
            if (listingPrice > listingFloorPrice) {
                unchecked {
                    collectionToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, oldListing.owner, listingPrice - listingFloorPrice);
                }
            }

            // Reduce the amount of listings
            unchecked { listingCount[_collection] -= 1; }
        }
//
    }
```

Let's go step by step to see how this will create problem for the owner:
1. Suppose a token is liquidated, which set the `_isLiquidation = true` for that tokenId in listing.sol
2. A user reserved that tokenId(_isLiquidation is not deleted) & withdrawn that token from protectedListing.sol
3. He listed that tokenId in listing.sol paying tax amount.
4. Now, if that tokenId is filled then owner should get tax refund amount(if any) but will not receive due to _isLiquidation = true for that tokenId.
```solidity
 function _fillListing(address _collection, address _collectionToken, uint _tokenId) private {
//
        if (_listings[_collection][_tokenId].owner != address(0)) {
            // Check if there is collateral on the listing, as this we bypass fees and refunds
            if (!_isLiquidation[_collection][_tokenId]) {
                // Find the amount of prepaid tax from current timestamp to prepaid timestamp
                // and refund unused gas to the user.
>                (uint fee, uint refund) = _resolveListingTax(_listings[_collection][_tokenId], _collection, false);
                emit ListingFeeCaptured(_collection, _tokenId, fee);
//
    }
```
