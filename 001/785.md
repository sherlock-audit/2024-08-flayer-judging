# Incorrect index of checkpoint

## Summary
If the checkpoint is updated and the previous timestamp and current are the same (i.e they are within the same block) the index returned is incorrect.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `ProtectedListings::_createCheckpoint` function updates the `collectionCheckpoints` mapping whenever a change in the number of listings occurs and returns the index at which the latest checkpoint is stored.
In the `ProtectedListings::_createCheckpoint` [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L530C14-L530C31) if the timestamp of a listing is the same as the previous one in the array the `compoundedFactor` of the previous checkpoint is changed and used as the updated checkpoint. However, the index is calculated as the length of the array which is incorrect.

## Impact
The checkpoint index is incorrect and points to a non-existing array index, and since this is used in calculating the unlock price therefore the unlock price will also be incorrect.
