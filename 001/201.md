# Lack of update checkpoint in Lock::deposit/redeem

## Summary
Lock::deposit/redeem will change the `utilizationRate` in ProtectedListing. Borrowers in ProtectedListing may pay more or less borrowing rate fees.

## Vulnerability Detail
Users can borrow some ERC20 tokens via some ERC721 collection collateral. The borrowing rate is related with `utilizationRate`
The `utilizationRate` is related with collectionToken's totalSupply.
The problem is that when users depoist/redeem in Locker, the totalSupply will change. This will impact the actual the borrowing rate. But we don't update the checkpoint timely. 
In one inactive collection market, borrowers can make user of this vulnerability to decrease his borrowing fees.
For example:
1. Alice deposits some ERC721s into the locker to increase the totalSupply.
2. Alice borrows some collection tokens via one low borrow interest.
3. Alice redeems ERC721 tokens from the locker.

```solidity
    function utilizationRate(address _collection) public view virtual returns (uint listingsOfType_, uint utilizationRate_) {
        listingsOfType_ = listingCount[_collection];
        if (listingsOfType_ != 0) {
            ICollectionToken collectionToken = locker.collectionToken(_collection);

            uint totalSupply = collectionToken.totalSupply();
            if (totalSupply != 0) {
                utilizationRate_ = (listingsOfType_ * 1e36 * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination()) / totalSupply;
            }
        }
    }
```

## Impact
Borrowers may pay more or less borrowing interest fees than expected.

Timely update checkpoint when we deposit/redeem in locker.
