# Anyone can block collection shutdown execution and lock up voters' tokens and prevent them from claiming ETH shares

### Summary

Anyone can still create a [listing](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L130-L166) or a [protected listing](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L117-L156) for a collection that has reached quorum for shutdown. There are no checks that prevent this.

However, shutdown can not be executed [while listings exist](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L241).

### Root Cause

Allowing creation of new listings or protected listings when shutdown of a collection has already started or executed can prevent shutdown from executing indefinitely.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Collection shutdown has [reached quorum](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L208-L211).

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Shutdown can be executed since voter quorum has been reached. However, it can be blocked by anyone who creates a listing or protected listing. 
2. Attacker [creates a protected listing](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L117-L156) for the target collection only borrowing 1 fToken. Since it is a protected listing, it can only be [liquidated](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L431-L432) once collateral has run out. For collateral to run out, the [`unlockPrice`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L500) must be greater than `0.95e18`. However, a collateral of 1 will only compound to 8 after 10 years with a utilization rate of 80%.
3. The attacker has blocked the collection shutdown for an indefinite period. 

### Impact

The shutdown voters lose their collection tokens and NFTs for an indefinite period. The cost of locking up the attacker's NFT for 10 years is only 4-10 fTokens (dust amounts).



### PoC

The following test can be added to `TaxCalculator.t.sol`. 

```solidity
function test_Compounding() public view {
    uint compoundedFactor = taxCalculator.calculateCompoundedFactor(1e18, 0.8 ether, 10 * 365 days);
    compoundedFactor = compoundedFactor * 1e18 / 1e18;
    // @audit the below code simulates `TaxCalculator::compound()`
    uint compoundedAmount = 1 * compoundedFactor / 1e18;
    console.log("Compounded Amount: ", compoundedAmount);
}
```

The test shows that the compounded amount for a principal/collateral of 1 with a utilization rate of 80% and a duration of 10 years is only 8.
