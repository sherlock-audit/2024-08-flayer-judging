# `Listings::reserve()` doesn't delete reserved listings causing integration issue

### Summary

`Listings::reserve()` doesn't delete the original `_listings` mapping of NFT token that was reserved causing it to be shown as listed when its actually a protected listings in `protectedListings` contract

### Root Cause

undeleted `_listings` mapping of NFT token after its reserved

### Internal pre-conditions

Token to be listed initially.

### External pre-conditions

Another user comes and reserve the listed token

### Attack Path

When user initially creates a listing [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L130-L166) it gets mapped to `_listings` map in the following function

```solidity
File: Listings.sol
242:     function _mapListings(CreateListing calldata _createListing, uint _tokenIds) private returns (uint tokensReceived_) {
243:         // Loop through our tokens
244:         for (uint i; i < _tokenIds; ++i) {
245:             // Create our initial listing and update the timestamp of the listing creation to now
246:             _listings[_createListing.collection][_createListing.tokenIds[i]] = Listing({
247:                 owner: _createListing.listing.owner,
248:                 created: uint40(block.timestamp),
249:                 duration: _createListing.listing.duration,
250:                 floorMultiple: _createListing.listing.floorMultiple
251:             });
252:         }
253: 
254:         // Our user will always receive one ERC20 per ERC721
255:         tokensReceived_ = _tokenIds * 1 ether;
256:     }
```

Now a user see this NFT and wants to `reserve()` it [Here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L690-L759) that doesn't delete the old listing and creates protected listing
```solidity
File: Listings.sol
737:         uint[] memory tokenIds = new uint[](1);
738:         tokenIds[0] = _tokenId;
739:         IProtectedListings.CreateListing[] memory createProtectedListing = new IProtectedListings.CreateListing[](1);
740:         createProtectedListing[0] = IProtectedListings.CreateListing({
741:             collection: _collection,
742:             tokenIds: tokenIds,
743:             listing: IProtectedListings.ProtectedListing({
744:                 owner: payable(address(this)),
745:                 tokenTaken: uint96(1 ether - _collateral),
746:                 checkpoint: 0 // Set in the `createListings` call
747:             })
748:         });
749: 
750:         // Create our listing, receiving the ERC20 into this contract
751:         protectedListings.createListings(createProtectedListing);
```

Now The user can unlock his protected Listing [Here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L287-L329) and can have the NFT in his wallet, yet the `_listings` mapping in `Listings` contract still shows that NFT as listing 

### Impact

Quoting this from the audit readMe
> ### Q: Should potential issues, like broken assumptions about function behavior, be reported if they could pose risks in future integrations, even if they might not be an issue in the context of the scope? If yes, can you elaborate on properties/invariants that should hold?
>  
>  **Flayer**
>  
>  Responses such as expected fees and tax calculations should be correct for external protocols to utilise. It is also important that each NFT has a correct status. Having tokens that arenâ€™t held by Flayer listed as for sale, protected listings missing, etc. would be detrimental.


Now as described above There will be a listing that shown as a listing in `listings.sol` when its actually reserved in `protectedListings` contract Causing integration issue and contradicting the readMe

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Delete the listings in `reserve()` function
