# Malicious user can cancel() already sunset collection using `vote()`

## Summary
Malicious user can cancel() already sunset collection using `vote()` as it doesn't check if collection is already sunset

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's go step by step
1. Suppose a collection is already sunset/executed, therefore its `canExecute = false`
```solidity
function execute(address _collection, uint[] calldata _tokenIds) public onlyOwner whenNotPaused {
//
        // Prevent the collection from being executed again
>        params.canExecute = false;
        emit CollectionShutdownExecuted(_collection, pool, _tokenIds);
    }
```
2. Malicious user voted for that collection using vote(), that doesn't check if collection is already sunset. therefore it set the canExecute = true(because shutdownVotes are >= quorumVotes)
```solidity
function _vote(address _collection, CollectionShutdownParams memory params) internal returns (CollectionShutdownParams memory) {
//
        // If we can execute, then we need to fire another event
        if (!params.canExecute && params.shutdownVotes >= params.quorumVotes) {
>           params.canExecute = true;
            emit CollectionShutdownQuorumReached(_collection);
        }
//
    }
```
3. Malicious user then calls cancel(), and it will not revert because it only checks `canExecute = true` & deletes the `_collectionParams` mapping, which contains `availableClaim`(ETH amount)
```solidity
    function cancel(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
        // Ensure that the vote count has reached quorum
        CollectionShutdownParams memory params = _collectionParams[_collection];
>       if (!params.canExecute) revert ShutdownNotReachedQuorum();
//
        // Remove our execution flag
>       delete _collectionParams[_collection];
        emit CollectionShutdownCancelled(_collection);
    }
```
4. When users will try to claim their ETH, they will receive 0 ETH as availableClaim is 0 due to deletion of `_collectionParams` mapping
```solidity
function claim(address _collection, address payable _claimant) public nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
//
        // Get the number of votes from the claimant and the total supply and determine from that the percentage
        // of the available funds that they are able to claim.
>       uint amount = params.availableClaim * claimableVotes / (params.quorumVotes * ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT / SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT);
        (bool sent,) = _claimant.call{value: amount}('');
        if (!sent) revert FailedToClaim();
//
    }
```

## Impact
Users will lose their ETH

## Recommendation
Don't allow to vote or cancel if collection is already sunset/executed
