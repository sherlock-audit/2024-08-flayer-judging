# Utilization rate only takes into account protected listings, which leads to loss of interest.

## Summary
To calculate the compound interest of LockBox listings we should use the utilization rate of the flayer pool. However we currently only factor the `protectedListings`, not the total amount of listings.

And disclaimer: This was also discussed with the Sponsor and he confirmed.

## Vulnerability Detail

The whitepaper clearly talks about one pool when mentioning listings, not for separate pools. - [flayer whitepaper](https://www.flayer.io/whitepaper)
We have 1 "virtual pool" per collection.

> This is similar to Liquid Listings however deposited items are not available for purchase but instead have a variable interest rate based on pool utilisation.

> Re-Listing: Arbitrageurs can permissionlessly curate listings by re-listing assets without having to take on the risk of buying the asset from the pool.

> Reservations: Users can reserve items in the pool by putting up collateral and paying an interest rate.

> ƒlayer allows any non-floor item within a collection to be deposited into a collection’s pool as a Liquid Listing,

Additionally in CollectionShutdown we factor all the listings, correctly, as it should be - [code snippet](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L497-L514) 

Semantically, this should be identical, as we are talking about the same pool for the same collection.

This is how the utilizationRate() in ProtectedListings.sol function is currently defined:
```solidity
    function utilizationRate(address _collection) public view virtual returns (uint listingsOfType_, uint utilizationRate_) {
        // Get the count of active listings of the specified listing type
@>>     listingsOfType_ = listingCount[_collection];

        // If we have listings of this type then we need to calculate the percentage, otherwise
        // we will just return a zero percent value.
        if (listingsOfType_ != 0) {
            ICollectionToken collectionToken = locker.collectionToken(_collection);

            // If we have no totalSupply, then we have a zero percent utilization
            uint totalSupply = collectionToken.totalSupply();
            if (totalSupply != 0) {
                utilizationRate_ = (listingsOfType_ * 1e36 * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination()) / totalSupply;
            }
        }
    }
```

However as seen:
- We have confusing comments as we don't specify any listingType
- We are only factoring in the listings from `ProtectedListings.sol`, which makes no sense, as the Flayer pool, as defined should reflect all the listings, including `liquid`, `dutch` and `lockbox`. The `ProtectedListings.sol` and `Listings.sol` interact with each other for the different types of listings and also for tracking the utilization rate which is used for the compoundFactor's calculation, for example the `Listings.sol` contract calls `createCheckpoint` when changing the totalSupply.

## Impact

Not factoring in **all the listings** when calculating the **utilization rate** for the pool will lead to **lower interest rates** and **loss of fees** that could have been deposited into the pool for **UniswapV4 swaps** and distributed to **LP providers**.

`getProtectedListingHealth()` tracks the **health position** of a specific **lockbox listing**, or one that was reserved via `reserve()` from **Listings.sol**.
```solidity
    function getProtectedListingHealth(....) {
        return int(MAX_PROTECTED_TOKEN_AMOUNT) - int(unlockPrice(_collection, _tokenId));
    }
```    

unlockPrice() takes the currentCheckpoint, which is calculated using the utilization rate - [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L549)
```solidity
    function unlockPrice(address _collection, uint _tokenId) public view returns (uint unlockPrice_) {
        ProtectedListing memory listing = _protectedListings[_collection][_tokenId];
        unlockPrice_ = locker.taxCalculator().compound({
            _principle: listing.tokenTaken,
            _initialCheckpoint: collectionCheckpoints[_collection][listing.checkpoint],
@>>         _currentCheckpoint: _currentCheckpoint(_collection)
        });
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add listings:
```diff
    function utilizationRate(address _collection) public view virtual returns (uint listingsOfType_, uint utilizationRate_) {
        listingsOfType_ = listingCount[_collection];
+       listingsOfType_ += _listings.listingCount(_collection);
        if (listingsOfType_ != 0) {
            ICollectionToken collectionToken = locker.collectionToken(_collection);
            uint totalSupply = collectionToken.totalSupply();
            if (totalSupply != 0) {
                utilizationRate_ = (listingsOfType_ * 1e36 * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination()) / totalSupply;
            }
        }
    }
```    

Since Locker.sol deposits are also part of the pool, consider also tracking the deposit count and using it for the utilization rate.
