# Voters can not recover their collection tokens after shutdown is canceled

### Summary

Since `_collectionParams` is deleted when canceling a shutdown, there is no way for shutdown voters to reclaim their tokens.

### Root Cause

In `CollectionShutdown::cancel():403`, the `_collectionParams` is deleted and no distribution of collection tokens to the user is done.

ref: [`CollectionShutdown::cancel():403`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L403)
```solidity
    delete _collectionParams[_collection];
```

There are only 2 ways for voters to retrieve their tokens.
1. `reclaimVote()` - This fails because `params.shutdownVotes` is now 0 since it was deleted in `cancel()`. It will revert due to underflow.
ref: [`CollectionShutdown::reclaimVote():369`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L368-L370)
```solidity
    // @audit This will revert due to underflow.
    params.shutdownVotes -= uint96(userVotes);
```
2.  `claim()` - This can only be run when the shutdown has been executed. Since shutdown was canceled, this will revert with `ShutdownNotExecuted`.
ref: [`CollectionShutdown::claim():291-292`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L291-L292)

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A collection for shutdown has increased its total supply of collection tokens. An attacker/user can force this by depositing NFTs to mint more collection tokens.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Anyone [`start()`s shutdown](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L147) of a collection since its total supply has decreased below the shutdown threshold. 
2. Collection Token holders call [`vote()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L197) to vote for shutdown in exchange for their tokens locked in `CollectionShutdown`.
3. The total supply of the collection token has increased above the threshold since users [`deposited()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L163) NFTs and minted more collection tokens.
4. Anyone calls [`cancel()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L390-L405) to stop the shutdown of the collection.
5. Any collection tokens of the target collection that were locked in `CollectionShutdown` can no longer be recovered.

### Impact

The impact is a permanent loss of collection tokens for shutdown voters in the affected collection.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider modifying `reclaimVote()` to the following:

ref: [`CollectionShutdown::reclaimVote():369`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L369)
```diff
-  params.shutdownVotes -= uint96(userVotes);
+  if (params.shutdownVotes > 0) params.shutdownVotes -= uint96(userVotes); 
```
