# Malicious user can bypass execution of  `CollectionShutdown` function

### Summary

Malicious user bypasses `CollectionShutdown::preventShutdown` by calling `CollectionShutdown::start` then `CollectionShutdown::reclaimVote` making the use of checks in `preventShutdown` useless.

### Root Cause

In `preventShutdown` function there a check to make sure there isn't currently a shutdown in progress.

[CollectionShutdown.sol#L420-L421](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L420-L421)

```solidity
File: CollectionShutdown.sol
415:     function preventShutdown(address _collection, bool _prevent) public {
416:         // Make sure our user is a locker manager
417:         if (!locker.lockerManager().isManager(msg.sender)) revert ILocker.CallerIsNotManager();
418: 
419:         // Make sure that there isn't currently a shutdown in progress
420:@>       if (_collectionParams[_collection].shutdownVotes != 0) revert ShutdownProcessAlreadyStarted();
421: 
422:         // Update the shutdown to be prevented
423:         shutdownPrevented[_collection] = _prevent;
424:         emit CollectionShutdownPrevention(_collection, _prevent);
425:     }
```

This check doesn't confirm that the shutdown is in progress or not user can call `CollectionShutdown::start` to start a shutdown.  
Then `CollectionShutdown::reclaimVote` to set shutdownVotes back to 0.

Calling `start` function indeed increas the votes by calling `_vote`  
[CollectionShutdown.sol#L156-L157](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L156-L157)

```solidity
File: CollectionShutdown.sol
135:     function start(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
//code
155:         // Cast our vote from the user
156:@>       _collectionParams[_collection] = _vote(_collection, params);
```

In `_votes` the count of shotdowVotes increase which is normal  
[CollectionShutdown.sol#L200-L201](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L200-L201)

```solidity
File: CollectionShutdown.sol
191:     function _vote(address _collection, CollectionShutdownParams memory params) internal returns (CollectionShutdownParams memory) {
//code
199:         // Register the amount of votes sent as a whole, and store them against the user
200:@>       params.shutdownVotes += uint96(userVotes);
```

There is no prevention for the use initiated the shutdown from calling `reclaimVote` .
[CollectionShutdown.sol#L369-L370](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L369-L370)

```solidity
File: CollectionShutdown.sol
356:     function reclaimVote(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
//code
368:         // We delete the votes that the user has attributed to the collection
369:@>       params.shutdownVotes -= uint96(userVotes);
```

This line resets back the shutdownVotes to 0  
Making `CollectionShutdown::preventShutdown` checks useless.

### Internal pre-conditions

- `lockerManager` calling `CollectionShutdown::preventShutdown` .

### Attack Path 1

1. `lockerManager` calling CollectionShutdown::preventShutdown.
2. Malicious user front run the `CollectionShutdown::preventShutdown` by calling `CollectionShutdown::start` and `CollectionShutdown::reclaimVote` .
3. `lockerManger` believe this collection is prevented from shutdown but its not.

### Attack Path 2

1. Malicious user calling `CollectionShutdown::start` and `CollectionShutdown::reclaimVote` .
2. `lockerManager` calling CollectionShutdown::preventShutdown.
3. `lockerManger` believe this collection is prevented from shutdown but its not.

### Impact

Bypass `preventShutdown` function making it useless.

### Mitigation

- When doing a shutdown check for `quorumVotes` or check during `vote()` that the collection is prevented from shutdown.

Change the check in `preventShutdown`.

```diff
-         if (_collectionParams[_collection].shutdownVotes != 0) revert ShutdownProcessAlreadyStarted();
+         if (_collectionParams[_collection].quorumVotes != 0) revert ShutdownProcessAlreadyStarted();
```
