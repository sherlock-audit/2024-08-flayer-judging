# Fees are burnt instead of deposited to uniswap implementation during unlocks

## Summary
The burnt amount is more than intended on `ProtectedListings.unlockProtectedListing`. The fees(tax) is also burnt, but they should have been sent to the uniswap implementation.deposit fees for the pool stakers (LPs).

Imapct: loss of fee / potential intended yield generation to the LPs
Root casue: wrong mechanism 

Look at the similar [Listings.cancelListings](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L451-L459), where the fees is charged and not burnt. But sent to uniswap implementation queuing for next donation to the uniV4 LPs.

## Vulnerability Detail

Issue flow :
1. User creates a listing and tokens taken is 0.90 ether, max is 0.95 ether.
2. After 2 days, the user comes back, his unlock price is 0.92 ether now, so 0.02 ether of tax  is due.
3. So, on line 287 and 288, the fee will be 0.92 ether and that much collection tokens are burned from user.
4. Again, on line 293, (1 ether  - token taken) = (1 - 0.9) = 0.1 ether is burned from the protected listing contract istelf.

If you calculate the total burnt amount, its 0.92 from user and 0.1 from contract, so total burnt is 1.02 ether.
This is wrong, the correct flow would be to burn only 0.9 from user and remaining tax of 0.02 ether for those 2 days should be sent to the uniswap implementation to deposit it as fees for the uniV4 pool. And the (1 - 0.9) = 0.1 ether burnt from contarct is the correct flow. So, noe this new way would result in (0.9 + 0.1) = 1 ether burnt and 0.02 is deposited as fees.

```solidity
ProtectedListings.sol

270:     function unlockProtectedListing(address _collection, uint _tokenId, bool _withdraw) public lockerNotPaused {
271:         // Ensure this is a protected listing
272:         ProtectedListing memory listing = _protectedListings[_collection][_tokenId];
---- SNIP ----
285: 
286:         // Repay the loaned amount, plus a fee from lock duration
287:   >>    uint fee = unlockPrice(_collection, _tokenId) * 10 ** denomination;
288:   >>    collectionToken.burnFrom(msg.sender, fee);
291: 
292:         // We need to burn the amount that was paid into the Listings contract
293:   >>    collectionToken.burn((1 ether - tokenTaken) * 10 ** denomination);
294: 
295:         // Remove our listing type
296:         unchecked { --listingCount[_collection]; }
297: 
---- SNIP ----
314:     }

```


## Impact
There will always be unlocks of listings in protected listing.sol, and the fees has to be deposited to LPs instead of burning them. Its a loss of fees/potential yeild. And the likelihood is always because 8/10 listings will be unlocked and only 2 - 3 / 10 will be liquidated.
