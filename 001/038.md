# relist() can be used to `prevent` a tokenId from filling/selling with less than 0.15% of one collectionToken

## Summary
relist() can be used to `prevent` a tokenId from filling/selling with less than 0.15% of `1 collectionToken` due to not verifying `listings.created`

## Vulnerability Detail
Users can relist a tokenId, paying listingPrice & taxRequired. However, if the token is `floor token`(ie deposited in Locker.sol contract through Locker:deposit()) then user only have to pay taxRequired.

Now, when a token is filled/sold using `fillListings()`, it checks whether `tokenId` is available to sold or not. If `listing.created` is in future then it returns `false` as availability.
```solidity
    function _fillListing(address _collection, address _collectionToken, uint _tokenId) private {
        // Get our listing information
@>      (bool isAvailable, uint price) = getListingPrice(_collection, _tokenId);
...

        // If the listing is invalid, then we prevent the buy
@>      if (!isAvailable) revert ListingNotAvailable();
...
    }
```
```solidity
 function getListingPrice(address _collection, uint _tokenId) public view returns (bool isAvailable_, uint price_) {
...
        // This is an edge case, but protects against potential future logic. If the
        // listing starts in the future, then we can't sell the listing.
@>      if (listing.created > block.timestamp) {
            return (isAvailable_, totalPrice);
        }
...
    }
```
To relist a tokenId, relist() takes CreateListing struct, which has a Listing struct that contains info like owner/ floorMultiple/ created/ duration.

Now the problem is, `owner/ floorMultiple/ duration` are verified through `_validateCreateListing(listing)`, but `Listing.created` is not verified & directly set to `_listings` mapping, which means a user can pass Listing.created either in `past` or `future`.
```solidity
function relist(CreateListing calldata _listing, bool _payTaxWithEscrow) public nonReentrant lockerNotPaused {
...
          // Load our new Listing into memory
@>       Listing memory listing = _listing.listing;

...
        // Validate our new listing
@>      _validateCreateListing(_listing);

        // Store our listing into our Listing mappings
@>      _listings[_collection][_tokenId] = listing;

        // Pay our required taxes
        payTaxWithEscrow(address(collectionToken), getListingTaxRequired(listing, _collection), _payTaxWithEscrow);
    }
```

Lets see how a malicious user can exploit this to prevent a tokenId from selling/filling only with less than 0.15% of 1 collectionToken
1. Suppose a user deposited tokenId = 1 in Locker.sol contract through deposit() & got 1e18 collectionToken(assuming denomination = 0)
2. Malicious user relisted it using relist(), passing `floorMultiple = 101` & `duration = 1 days` & `created = in very future`. He will only pay `taxRequired`, not listingPrice as this is a floor/base token. Lets see how much tax malicious user have to pay..
3. According to below code, taxRequired will be `(101 ** 2 * 1e12 * 86400) / 604800 =~ 1.428571e15`
```solidity
  function calculateTax(address _collection, uint _floorMultiple, uint _duration) public pure returns (uint taxRequired_) {
        // If we have a high floor multiplier, then we want to soften the increase
        // after a set amount to promote grail listings.
        if (_floorMultiple > FLOOR_MULTIPLE_KINK) {
            _floorMultiple = FLOOR_MULTIPLE_KINK + ((_floorMultiple - FLOOR_MULTIPLE_KINK) / 2);
        }

        // Calculate the tax required per second
        taxRequired_ = (_floorMultiple ** 2 * 1e12 * _duration) / 7 days;
    }
```
4. If you calculate the percentage of `1.428571e15` out of `1 collectionToken` ie 1e18 then it would come out to be ~0.14%, which is nothing. But as we saw in above code, if listing.created is in future then can't be sold
5. Malicious user can prevent `hundreds` of tokenId from selling, just with `1 collectionToken`

## Impact
Malicious user can prevent hundreds of tokenId from selling by setting their created time is very future

## Recommendation
Instead of directly setting listing to _listing mapping, use `_mapListings()`, which is also used in `createListings()`. It sets the listing.created to block.timestamp
