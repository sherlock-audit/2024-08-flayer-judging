# Inaccurate Quorum Calculation in Collection Shutdown due to Premature Vote Reclaim Restriction

### Summary

## Inaccurate Quorum Calculation in Collection Shutdown due to Premature Vote Reclaim Restriction

**1. Bug Title:** Inaccurate Quorum Calculation in Collection Shutdown due to Premature Vote Reclaim Restriction

**2. Trigger Condition:** This bug can be triggered when:

- A collection shutdown process has been initiated using `start()`.
- Users have voted, and the required quorum (`shutdownVotes >= quorumVotes`) for the shutdown has been achieved, setting `params.canExecute = true`.
- **Before** the owner of the `CollectionShutdown` contract calls `execute()` to proceed with the shutdown, one or more users decide to reclaim their votes by calling `reclaimVote()`. 

**3. PoC Flow:**

1. **Start Shutdown:** A user calls `start(collectionAddress)` initiating a collection shutdown process.
2. **Users Vote:** Multiple users holding `CollectionToken` for the given collection call `vote(collectionAddress)`. Their votes are accumulated in `shutdownVotes`, eventually exceeding `quorumVotes`, setting `params.canExecute = true`.
3. **User Reclaims Vote:** At least one of the voting users, before the owner calls `execute()`, changes their mind and calls `reclaimVote(collectionAddress)`. Their votes are deducted from `shutdownVotes`, potentially causing it to drop below `quorumVotes`.
4. **Owner Executes Shutdown:** The `CollectionShutdown` contract owner calls `execute(collectionAddress, tokenIds)`. The `execute` function checks if `canExecute` is true (it still is, from step 2) but finds that `shutdownVotes` might be less than `quorumVotes` due to the vote reclaim in step 3. 
5. **Shutdown Failure:** The `execute` function reverts with `ShutdownNotReachedQuorum()` even though enough users initially voted in favor of the shutdown, hindering the collection's sunsetting process.

**4. Detailed Impact:**

- **Blocked Shutdown:** The collection intended for shutdown cannot be properly liquidated and removed from the Flayer platform. This impacts both users wanting to exit the collection and the overall efficiency of the platform. 
- **Inconsistency:** The bug creates an inconsistency between the status of the collection (perceived as ready for execution due to `canExecute = true`) and the actual votes remaining.
- **Potential Misuse:** While not a direct exploit, a malicious actor could, in theory, repeatedly initiate shutdowns, encourage voting to reach quorum, and then quickly reclaim votes to prevent execution. This would unnecessarily burden the platform and potentially disrupt the intended usage of `CollectionShutdown`.

**5. Code Snippet (`reclaimVote` function):**

```solidity
 function reclaimVote(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
    // If the quorum has passed, then we can no longer reclaim as we are pending
    // an execution.
    CollectionShutdownParams storage params = _collectionParams[_collection];
    if (params.canExecute) revert ShutdownQuorumHasPassed();

    // Get the amount of votes that the user has cast for this collection
    uint userVotes = shutdownVoters[_collection][msg.sender];

    // If the user has not cast a vote, then we can revert early
    if (userVotes == 0) revert NoVotesPlacedYet();

    // We delete the votes that the user has attributed to the collection
    params.shutdownVotes -= uint96(userVotes);
    delete shutdownVoters[_collection][msg.sender];

    // We can now return their tokens
    params.collectionToken.transfer(msg.sender, userVotes);

    // Notify our stalkers that a vote has been reclaimed
    emit CollectionShutdownVoteReclaim(_collection, msg.sender, userVotes);
}
```

**In Conclusion:** This bug poses a significant risk to the smooth functioning of the `CollectionShutdown` mechanism. By wrongly restricting vote reclaims based solely on reaching quorum instead of actual execution, the code creates a vulnerability to inconsistent state and potentially disrupted shutdowns. Addressing this logic error is crucial to ensure proper and predictable execution of collection sunsetting in Flayer.
