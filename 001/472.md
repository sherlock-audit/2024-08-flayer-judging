# Tokens are stuck when CollectionShutdown.sol#cancel() is invoked

### Summary

Deletion of `_collectionParams[collection]` without sending tokens back to the users who voted will **leave tokens stucked** in the contract with no possibility of retrieving them back.

### Root Cause

Nothing is send back before this line of code -> https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L403
 
``` solidity
function cancel(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
        // Ensure that the vote count has reached quorum
        CollectionShutdownParams memory params = _collectionParams[_collection];
        if (!params.canExecute) revert ShutdownNotReachedQuorum();

        // Check if the total supply has surpassed an amount of the initial required
        // total supply. This would indicate that a collection has grown since the
        // initial shutdown was triggered and could result in an unsuspected liquidation.
        if (params.collectionToken.totalSupply() <= MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS * 10 ** locker.collectionToken(_collection).denomination()) {
            revert InsufficientTotalSupplyToCancel();
        }

        // Remove our execution flag
        // !! NOTHING IS SEND BEFORE DELETION !!
        delete _collectionParams[_collection];
        emit CollectionShutdownCancelled(_collection);
    }

### Internal pre-conditions

First, a vote needs to have started and then more tokens minted while it is ongoing so we exceed the MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS.

Then, a user (may be intentionally malicious) needs to invoke cancel() before the onlyOwner invokes execute().

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Steps:

We start a vote to shutdown a particular collection
We pass the required threshold, but the owner hasn't yet invoked execute()
During this time, new collection tokens are created and they pass the MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS
Cancel() is invoked and it deletes the _collectionParams[collection] without first sending the
tokens back to the users which voted
Tokens are stuck and there is no way for them to be retrieved, reclaimVote() and other functions
are all dependent on _collectionParams[collection], so they won't be able to send back the tokens to the users.

### Impact

User tokens are going to be stuck when the ```CollectionShutdown.sol#cancel()```  is invoked and,
there is no mechanism to claim them back.

### PoC

 ``` solidity
function test_StuckTokensAfterCancel() public {
        uint[] memory tokenIds = _mintTokensIntoCollection(erc721b, 3);
        vm.startPrank(address(locker));
        collectionToken.mint(address(this), 3 ether);
        vm.stopPrank();

        collectionShutdown.start(address(erc721b));
        
        vm.startPrank(address(locker));
        collectionToken.mint(address(this), 8 ether);
        vm.stopPrank();

        collectionShutdown.cancel(address(erc721b));

        // it will revert here in reclaimVote() -> params.shutdownVotes -= uint96(userVotes); 
        vm.expectRevert();
        collectionShutdown.reclaimVote(address(erc721b));

        // it will revert here in execute() -> if (!params.canExecute) revert ShutdownNotReachedQuorum();
        vm.expectRevert();
        collectionShutdown.execute(address(erc721b), tokenIds);
    }

### Mitigation

Implement a mechanism to send the tokens to the voters in `cancel()`
