# relisting a previously liquidated NFT will refund fees to original owner

### Summary

Users calling `Listings::relist()` to NFT id that was previously listed as liquidation will cause loss of funds to the protocol due to refunding fees to the original owner when he the liquidation listing doesn't pay fees upon creation

### Root Cause

- When user call `relist()` we don't check if the original listing was liquidation so that we delete the mapping `_isLiquidation`
- The problem is that when a liquidation is created it doesn't pay fees Here [`createLiquidationListing`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L178-L208)
- Now Listing owner him self can leverage the first point by calling `relist()` but from another wallet, immediately after the liquidation is started, this will refund him 4 days duration fees giving him more funds that he initially should have got

- The fact that you can relist a listed NFT with same price of current listing

### Internal pre-conditions

- There is a liquidated NFT that some users wants to relist, or the liquidated NFT owner can leverage this bug

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. When a liquidation is created its duration is 4 days and the floor multiple is 4_00 as seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L451-L462)
2. Any liquidations doesn't pay fees during creation by design as evident [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L178-L208) 
3. Once the liquidationListing is created there can be two scenarios profitable for the liquidated original owner
   1. There is User that sees it immediately and think its more valuable than 400 `FLOOR_MULTIPLE` and put it to high price, this will refund the 4 days duration fees to the liquidated user since function `relist()` doesn't check for liquidated tokens
    2. The liquidated original owner utilize the bug and use 3 `collectionToken` from another wallet to relist the liquidated NFT and `cancelListing` in the same txn, not paying for fees and utilizing the bug of refunding fees that wasn't initially paid
4. The fees are paid according to initially created duration `4 Days`, and will be funded to original liquidated owner [Here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L644) Since there is no check if the Listing is is `_isLiquidation` mapping
5. Those fees weren't owned to that owner and are taken from `collectionTokens` staying in the contract as fees from other listings
   
In the above scenario, the original owner of Liquidated NFT has got refunded fees from Liquidated position (a position that fees weren't paid for initially by design), causing loss of funds(`collectionToken`) and there will be times where the contract doesn't have enough balance to call [`depositFees`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L377) 

Calls causing any instance of functions having [`depositFees`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L377) call to revert due to actual balance present in contract will be less that the accounted for.

### Impact

Loss of funds from Listings contract and the accounting of fees gets corrupted compared to current balance and any filled listing that will call `implementation.depositFees()` will revert to due contract running out of balance

### Mitigation

Check and delete the `_isLiquidation` flag in relesting
