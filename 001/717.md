# `withdrawProtectedListing()` can be DoS

## Summary
`withdrawProtectedListing()` can be DoS

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user unlocks his protectedListing using `unlockProtectedListing()`, it deletes the `_protectedListings` mapping. The problem is this `_protectedListings` mapping is used in Locker.sol to check if tokenId is protected or not, and if protected it doesn't allow  any user to withdraw that token.
```solidity
 function unlockProtectedListing(address _collection, uint _tokenId, bool _withdraw) public lockerNotPaused {
//
        // Delete the listing objects
>       delete _protectedListings[_collection][_tokenId];
//
    }
```
Suppose a user unlock his protectedLisitngs to withdraw his tokenId later, now the _protectedListings mapping is deleted, which means any user can withdraw that tokenId from Locker.sol. As result, when user will try calling `withdrawProtectedListing()`, it will revert.
```solidity
 function withdrawProtectedListing(address _collection, uint _tokenId) public lockerNotPaused {
//
        // Transfer the asset to the user
>       locker.withdrawToken(_collection, _tokenId, msg.sender);
        emit ListingAssetWithdraw(_collection, _tokenId);
    }
```

## Impact
User will lose his NFT
