# The `shutdownVoters` is not processed in the `CollectionShutdown.sol#cancel()` function.

### Summary

In the `CollectionShutdown.sol#cancel()` function, `_collectionParams` is deleted regardless of the existence of `shutdownVoters`, so users cannot reclaim their collection tokens.


### Root Cause

In the `CollectionShutdown.sol#cancel()` function, delete `_collectionParams` regardless of the existence of `shutdownVoters`.


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

Users must have voted their collection tokens.

### Attack Path

Once the `CollectionShutdown.sol#cancel()` function is executed, users cannot call the `CollectionShutdown.sol#reclaimVote()` function.


### Impact

_No response_

### PoC

The [`CollectionShutdown.sol#cancel()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L390-L405) function deletes `_collectionParams` when the condition is met.
```solidity
    function cancel(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
        // Ensure that the vote count has reached quorum
        CollectionShutdownParams memory params = _collectionParams[_collection];
        if (!params.canExecute) revert ShutdownNotReachedQuorum();

        // Check if the total supply has surpassed an amount of the initial required
        // total supply. This would indicate that a collection has grown since the
        // initial shutdown was triggered and could result in an unsuspected liquidation.
        if (params.collectionToken.totalSupply() <= MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS * 10 ** locker.collectionToken(_collection).denomination()) {
            revert InsufficientTotalSupplyToCancel();
        }

        // Remove our execution flag
403:    delete _collectionParams[_collection];
        emit CollectionShutdownCancelled(_collection);
    }
```
Meanwhile, the [`CollectionShutdown.sol#reclaimVote()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L390-L405) function returns the collection token.
```solidity
    function reclaimVote(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
        // If the quorum has passed, then we can no longer reclaim as we are pending
        // an execution.
        CollectionShutdownParams storage params = _collectionParams[_collection];
        if (params.canExecute) revert ShutdownQuorumHasPassed();

        // Get the amount of votes that the user has cast for this collection
        uint userVotes = shutdownVoters[_collection][msg.sender];

        // If the user has not cast a vote, then we can revert early
        if (userVotes == 0) revert NoVotesPlacedYet();

        // We delete the votes that the user has attributed to the collection
369:    params.shutdownVotes -= uint96(userVotes);
        delete shutdownVoters[_collection][msg.sender];

        // We can now return their tokens
373:    params.collectionToken.transfer(msg.sender, userVotes);

        // Notify our stalkers that a vote has been reclaimed
        emit CollectionShutdownVoteReclaim(_collection, msg.sender, userVotes);
    }
```

But as you can see, `_collectionParams` has already been deleted in #L369, so `params.shutdownVotes` is 0.

Therefore, underflow occurs and the transaction is always reverted.

### Mitigation

- Manage `shutdownVoters` separately from `_collectionParams`.
- It is recommended to restrict the `CollectionShutdown.sol#cancel()` function to be called only by authorized users.
