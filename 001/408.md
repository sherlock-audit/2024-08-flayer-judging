# CollectionShutdown.start quorumVotes may be lower than the actual value



## Summary

CollectionShutdown.start `quorumVotes` lower than the actual value, allowing the vote to pass earlier

## Vulnerability Detail

CollectionShutdown.start function, `quorumVotes` is based on `collectionToken.totalSupply` calculated:

```solidity
    function start(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
        .....
        params.collectionToken = locker.collectionToken(_collection);
        uint totalSupply = params.collectionToken.totalSupply(); 
        .....
        params.quorumVotes = uint88(totalSupply * SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT / ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT);
        .....
    }
```

But the problem is that `totalSupply` can still be increased after start, and the increased tokens can also be used for voting, so `quorumVotes` will be actually smaller. Attackers can use this to manipulate voting.

## Impact
Let the vote pass early, attackers can manipulate the vote.
