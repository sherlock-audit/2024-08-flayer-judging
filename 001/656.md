# The total supply of collection tokens will be decreased more and more.

## Summary
`ProtectedListings::unlockProtectedListing()` burn more than `1 ether` of collection tokens per 1 NFT.
Therefore, the total supply of collection tokens will be decreased more and more compared to the number of NFT holdings.

## Vulnerability Detail
Assume that denomination of collection is 1 for simplicity. The code of `ProtectedListings::unlockProtectedListing()` is the following.
```solidity
    function unlockProtectedListing(address _collection, uint _tokenId, bool _withdraw) public lockerNotPaused {
        // Ensure this is a protected listing
        ProtectedListing memory listing = _protectedListings[_collection][_tokenId];

        // Ensure the caller owns the listing
        if (listing.owner != msg.sender) revert CallerIsNotOwner(listing.owner);

        // Ensure that the protected listing has run out of collateral
        int collateral = getProtectedListingHealth(_collection, _tokenId);
        if (collateral < 0) revert InsufficientCollateral();

        // cache
        ICollectionToken collectionToken = locker.collectionToken(_collection);
        uint denomination = collectionToken.denomination();
        uint96 tokenTaken = _protectedListings[_collection][_tokenId].tokenTaken;

        // Repay the loaned amount, plus a fee from lock duration
        uint fee = unlockPrice(_collection, _tokenId) * 10 ** denomination;
305     collectionToken.burnFrom(msg.sender, fee);

        // We need to burn the amount that was paid into the Listings contract
308     collectionToken.burn((1 ether - tokenTaken) * 10 ** denomination);

        ... SKIP ...
    }
```
The burnt amount of collection token in `L305` and `L308` is larger than `1 ether` while withdrawing 1 NFT. Therefore, the total supply of collection tokens will be decreased whenever protected listings are unlocked.

## Impact
As the total supply of collection tokens is decreased, the price of NFT represented by collection token will fail. Then some listing NFTs will be priced lower than `1 ether`. Therefore, some NFTs will not be listed in the `Listings.sol`. This means that the protocol become useless for some NFTs.

## Recommendation
Burn only `1 ether` of collection tokens per 1 NFT.
