# User may not be able to reclaim collection shutdown votes

## Summary
User may not be able to reclaim collection shutdown votes.

## Vulnerability Detail

As the comments says, user is able to reclaim votes **at any time**.

[CollectionShutdown.sol#L350-L356](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L350-L356):
```solidity
    /**
     * If the user changes their mind regarding their vote, then they can retract it
     * at any time. This will remove their vote and return their token.
     *
     * @param _collection The collection address
     */
    function reclaimVote(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
```

Therefore it is reasonable to think that user can claim their votes even after the shutdown has been executed and the collection has been fully liquidated. 

However, it not always the case. After shutdown, anyone can [claim](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L285) liquidation share on behave of others, for example, it's possible that Bob claims shares on behave of Alice, after the claim, Alice's `shutdownVoters` info is deleted, results in Alice won't be able to reclaim her votes.

[CollectionShutdown.sol#L305-L306](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L305-L306):
```solidity
        // Set our available tokens to claim to zero
        delete shutdownVoters[_collection][_claimant];
```

## Impact

User won't be able to reclaim votes at any time as promised.
