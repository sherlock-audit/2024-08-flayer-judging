# Voters can't withdraw their collection tokens after a shutdown is canceled

### Summary

Canceling a collection shutdown will prevent voters from claiming their votes, locking their collection tokens in the `CollectionShutdown` contract.

### Root Cause

The function [CollectionShutdown::cancel()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L390) deletes the whole `_collectionParams[_collection]` struct at the end of execution, including the `shutdownVotes` variable. This will prevent voters from reclaiming their collection tokens as the [reclaimVote()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L356) function will revert for underflow when lowering the `shutdownVotes` variable:
```solidity
params.shutdownVotes -= uint96(userVotes);
```
[CollectionShutdown.sol#L369](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L369)

### Attack Path

1. A collection shutdown is started via [start()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L135)
2. Users start voting via [vote()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L175), locking up their collection tokens
3. The total supply of collection tokens increases (ex. some ERC721 deposits are made) enough for [cancel()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L390) to be called, which deletes the `shutdownVotes` variable
4. The collection shutdown is canceled but users that voted cannot recover their tokens via [reclaimVote()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L356) as the call reverts

### Impact

Users that voted prior to canceling will lose their collection tokens.

### Mitigation

In [cancel()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L390) don't delete the `shutdownVotes` variable at the end of execution.
