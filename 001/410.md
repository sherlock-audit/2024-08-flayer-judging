# Users with more than 50% of the voting rights can steal other users' tokens.



## Summary
1. Users with more than 50% of the voting rights can steal other users' tokens.
2. Anyone can get more than 50% of the voting power after the start of shutdown (start is called).

## Vulnerability Detail

`claim` calculates the amount as follows:
    uint amount = params.availableClaim * claimableVotes / (params.quorumVotes * ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT / SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT);

`params.quorumVotes` is set at start:

```solidity
    function start(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
        .....
        uint totalSupply = params.collectionToken.totalSupply(); 
        .....
        params.quorumVotes = uint88(totalSupply * SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT / ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT);
        ....
    }
```

But the problem is that `params.quorumVotes` can still be changed after `execute`:

Calling `start` again` params.quorumVotes` will be recalculated, but params.shutdownVotes = 0,
If the attacker has more than 50% of the voting power, and all the voting is initiated by the attacker, the attacker can `reclaimVote` after the vote is closed, making params.shutdownVotes = 0

`reclaimVote` will reduce `params.shutdownVotes`:
```solidity
    function reclaimVote(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
        // If the quorum has passed, then we can no longer reclaim as we are pending
        // an execution.
        CollectionShutdownParams storage params = _collectionParams[_collection];
        if (params.canExecute) revert ShutdownQuorumHasPassed();

        // Get the amount of votes that the user has cast for this collection
        uint userVotes = shutdownVoters[_collection][msg.sender];

        // If the user has not cast a vote, then we can revert early
        if (userVotes == 0) revert NoVotesPlacedYet();

        // We delete the votes that the user has attributed to the collection
@>      params.shutdownVotes -= uint96(userVotes);
        delete shutdownVoters[_collection][msg.sender];

        // We can now return their tokens
        params.collectionToken.transfer(msg.sender, userVotes);

        // Notify our stalkers that a vote has been reclaimed
        emit CollectionShutdownVoteReclaim(_collection, msg.sender, userVotes);
    }
```

A reduction in `quorumVotes` will result in claimer receiving more ETH, based on the formula above:

```solidity
    uint amount = params.availableClaim * claimableVotes / (params.quorumVotes * ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT / SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT);
    // uint amount = params.availableClaim * claimableVotes / (params.quorumVotes * 2); //ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT / SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT = 2
    // uint amount = params.availableClaim * claimableVotes / totalSupply;
```

The end of the execute function makes `params.canExecute = false`, so `reclaimVote` can still `execute` after execute.

```solidity
 function execute(address _collection, uint[] calldata _tokenIds) public onlyOwner whenNotPaused {
        ......
        // Prevent the collection from being executed again
        params.canExecute = false;
        emit CollectionShutdownExecuted(_collection, pool, _tokenIds);
    }
```

The attack process is:
1. The attacker has more than 50% of `collectionTokens`
2. The attacker uses 50% of the tokens to initiate a vote, and the vote passes.
3. The administrator executes execute, and the NFT is sold out in `sudoswap`.
4. The attacker calls `reclaimVote` set `params.shutdownVotes` = 0
5. The attacker calls `voteAndClaim` `collectionToken.totalSupply` halved.
6. The attacker calls start to reset `quorumVotes`, and `quorumVotes` become half of the original number.
7. The calculated amount of `claim/voteAndClaim `is more than the actual amount.

Another problem is that the attacker can mint `collectionTokens` even after the `shutdown start`, so it is easy for the attacker to gain more than 50% of the voting power.

## Impact
Attackers steal other users' tokens

## Recommendation
Set a different state. After the vote is over, stop calling `start` again
