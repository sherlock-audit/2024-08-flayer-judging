# Governance Deadlock Due to Exclusion of Locked Votes in Future Collection Shutdown Attempts

### Summary

The improper handling of locked votes in `CollectionShutdown.sol` causes a governance deadlock, where future shutdown votes are blocked if the number of locked votes exceeds the quorum requirement. This occurs when users do not reclaim their votes after a canceled shutdown (which they can't in the current implementation), leading to an accumulation of unaccounted-for votes that prevents the successful execution of future shutdown attempts. Even if users can reclaim, they may avoid reclaiming their votes and re-vote if this process is burdensome, further exacerbating the issue.

### Root Cause

- In [`CollectionShutdown.sol:403`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L403), the `_collectionParams` are deleted when a shutdown is canceled, which causes the staked votes to remain in the contract without being considered in future shutdown attempts.
- When a new shutdown is initiated, the contract does not factor in the locked votes from previous shutdown attempts, leading to an artificial inflation of the quorum requirement and blocking future shutdowns if the locked votes exceed the quorum threshold.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A user with collection token balance must call `CollectionShutdown.start()` to initiate the shutdown process and set the `_collectionParams`.
2. The total supply of collection tokens must meet or exceed the threshold required to start the shutdown vote.
3. Users must stake their tokens in support of the shutdown, and the total number of votes cast must reach the quorum threshold, allowing the shutdown to enter the `canExecute` state.
4. The shutdown process must be canceled by calling `CollectionShutdown.cancel()`, without users reclaiming their previously staked votes.
5. A subsequent shutdown attempt must be initiated with locked votes still present in the contract from the previous shutdown attempt.

### External pre-conditions

No external pre-conditions required.

### Attack Path

1. User A votes to shut down a collection by calling `CollectionShutdown.start()` and staking their tokens. The shutdown enters the `canExecute` state after reaching the quorum.
2. Another user mints additional tokens, increasing the total supply beyond the shutdown threshold, which allows the shutdown to be canceled.
3. User A does not reclaim their staked votes after the shutdown is canceled, leaving their tokens locked in the contract.
4. A new shutdown process is initiated by another user, but the staked votes from User A are not counted towards the new votes amount.
5. The new shutdown fails because the total locked votes exceed the required quorum, effectively blocking future shutdown attempts unless users reclaim and restake their votes (which they can't in the current implementation).

### Impact

The exclusion of previously staked votes in future shutdown processes leads to a governance deadlock, with the following potential consequences:

- Inability to execute future shutdowns if the locked votes exceed the quorum requirement, as the votes calculation will not considering the locked votes from the old shutdown attempts.
- The deadlock creates an ongoing governance issue that can prevent the proper execution of shutdown votes, effectively freezing the collection and preventing important decisions from being made.
- Malicious users could intentionally lock votes to prevent future shutdowns, effectively manipulating governance processes.

        // Governance deadlock: shutdown can't reach quorum due to locked votes
        ICollectionShutdown.CollectionShutdownParams memory shutdownParams = collectionShutdown.collectionParams(address(erc721b));
        assertEq(shutdownParams.canExecute, false);
        // The shutdown will fail as locked votes are not considered in the new shutdown votes accounting
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

To resolve this issue, update the logic in `CollectionShutdown.start()` to account for previously staked votes when calculating the shutdown votes for a new shutdown process. The contract should either automatically include the locked votes from previous shutdowns in the new calculation or provide users with a streamlined process to reclaim and restake their votes.
