# Incorrect CheckPoint of ProtectedListings created within the same block

### Summary

The `ProtectedListings.sol#_createCheckpoint` function returns an incorrect `checkpointIndex` within the same block, making it impossible to access checkpoints of later created ProtectedListings.


### Root Cause

In the `ProtectedListings.sol#_createCheckpoint` function, the checkpoint is not pushed within the same block, but the previous checkpoint is updated, but `index_` returns `collectionCheckpoints[_collection].length` as it is, so an array out-of-bounds access error occurs, making it impossible to access the ProtectedListing.
Additionally, specifying an incorrect checkPoint can result in unexpected loss of funds.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

- After `_createCheckpoint()` is called within the same block, the `createListings()` function corresponding to the collection must be called.
- Assume that there is an access call to that ProtectedListing immediately after the function call to explane this issue.


### Attack Path

Since the `_createCheckpoint()` function can be called in the function implementation, we will assume that there are two calls at the same time.

- Alice creates a ProtectedListing using the [`ProtectedListings.sol#createListings()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L117) function.
- Bob calls the function concurrently, causing the transaction to be executed within the same block.
- At this time, the [`_createCheckpoint()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L564-L567) function updates the checkpoint pushed by Alice and returns the length of the array.

    Therefore, the checkpointIndex of Bob's ProtectedListing will be 1 more than Alice's checkpointIndex, which means that the corresponding checkpointIndex will be out of the indexing range of `collectionCheckpoints`.

    As a result, Bob cannot access his ProtectedListing.

### Impact

- Users will lose access to their ProtectedListing and therefore lose their NFTs.
- Incorrect checkpoint designation can result in unexpected loss of funds in the Protocol.

### PoC

```solidity
    function test_IncorrectCheckPointIndex(address payable _owner, uint _tokenId) public {
        _assumeValidTokenId(_tokenId);

        _assumeValidAddress(_owner);

        uint _tokenId2 = _tokenId + 10;

        // Mint our token to the _owner and approve the {Listings} contract to use it
        erc721a.mint(_owner, _tokenId);
        erc721a.mint(_owner, _tokenId2);

        vm.prank(_owner);
        erc721a.setApprovalForAll(address(protectedListings), true); //+++

        IProtectedListings.ProtectedListing memory listing = IProtectedListings.ProtectedListing({
            owner: _owner,
            tokenTaken: 0.4 ether,
            checkpoint: 0
        });


        // Create our listing
        vm.startPrank(_owner);
        _createProtectedListing({
            _listing: IProtectedListings.CreateListing({
                collection: address(erc721a),
                tokenIds: _tokenIdToArray(_tokenId),
                listing: listing
            })
        });

        _createProtectedListing({
            _listing: IProtectedListings.CreateListing({
                collection: address(erc721a),
                tokenIds: _tokenIdToArray(_tokenId2),
                listing: listing
            })
        });

        locker.collectionToken(address(erc721a)).approve(address(protectedListings), type(uint).max);
        protectedListings.unlockProtectedListing(address(erc721a), _tokenId2, true);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

### Mitigation

It is recommended to the `ProtectedListings.sol#_createCheckpoint()` function as follows:
```solidity
    function _createCheckpoint(address _collection) internal returns (uint index_) {
        // Determine the index that will be created
        index_ = collectionCheckpoints[_collection].length;

        // Register the checkpoint that has been created
        SNIP...

        // Get our new (current) checkpoint
        Checkpoint memory checkpoint = _currentCheckpoint(_collection);

        // If no time has passed in our new checkpoint, then we just need to update the
        // utilization rate of the existing checkpoint.
        if (checkpoint.timestamp == collectionCheckpoints[_collection][index_ - 1].timestamp) {
            collectionCheckpoints[_collection][index_ - 1].compoundedFactor = checkpoint.compoundedFactor;
---         return index_;
+++         return index_ - 1;
        }

        // Store the new (current) checkpoint
        collectionCheckpoints[_collection].push(checkpoint);
    }
```
