# reserving a previously liquidated Token will cause loss of funds to new owner

### Summary

Users calling `Listings::reserve()` to NFT id that was previously listed as liquidation will have loss of funds when a second user buy it from them through `fillListings()`

### Root Cause

- When user call `reserve()` we don't check if the original listing was liquidation so that we delete the mapping `_isLiquidation`

- Now it belongs to the new owner that is not liquidated and have paid the fees calculated according to duration and price

- when the new listing gets filled before the full duration passes through `fillListing()` it won't refund fees that was paid for duration not spent

### Internal pre-conditions

There is a liquidated NFT that the user wants to `reserve()`

### External pre-conditions

The reserved NFT gets

listed again through `createListings()` and then gets filled though `fillListings()`

### Attack Path

When an NFT token is liquidated from `protectedListings` its flagged as liquidation [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L195)  the liquidation is from user A

Now there can be a user (user B) where he sees that token and want to it through [`reserve()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L690) But the problem is that this function doesn't delete liquidation mapping after it checks it

Now user B unlock that token and list it through `createListings` 
 
(user B) will pay the required tax [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L149-L151) according to duration and floor by receiving less tokens from the floor as seen in the subtraction

The problem is that the NFT is not removed from liquidation flag

Now when another user (user  C) sees that listing and want to fill it through `fillListings()` that calls `_fillListings`
and the full duration of listing hasn't passed and user B still can and should get some fees refunded if user C fill it

there will be checks if the token is liquidation (in which our token is still flagged as liquidation although its not) [Here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L499-L519)
 
 This check will prevent user B from getting refunded the unused Fees, causing loss of funds

### Impact

Loss of fees that should have been refunded (loss of funds)

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

make `_isLiquidation` mapping to be per owner and not only the token Id
