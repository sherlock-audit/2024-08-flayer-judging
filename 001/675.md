# Overflow in `params.quorumVotes` while shutdown of a collection

## Summary
Overflow in `params.quorumVotes` while shutdown of a collection

## Vulnerability Detail
When a collection is sunset, it calculates the quorumVotes ie votes required to shutdown the collection. It is calculated using totalSupply of the collection.
```solidity
 function start(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
//
        // Get the total number of tokens still in circulation, specifying a maximum number
        // of tokens that can be present in a "dormant" collection.
        params.collectionToken = locker.collectionToken(_collection);
        uint totalSupply = params.collectionToken.totalSupply();
        if (totalSupply > MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS * 10 ** params.collectionToken.denomination()) revert TooManyItems();

        // Set our quorum vote requirement
>       params.quorumVotes = uint88(totalSupply * SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT / ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT);
//
    }
```

Problem is quorumVotes is uint88 while totalSupply is uint256. So when collectionToken will have denomination of 9, it will overflow the quorumVotes. Lets see how, assume denomination  = 9  & 4 NFTs are deposited. therefore totalSupply of collectionToken is 4e27. quorumVotes will be 2e27 but it can't handle such big number, leading to overflow. 

## Impact
quorumVotes will be much less than actual

## Recommendation
Use safeCast library or consider using uint256 for quorumVotes also
