# `Listings::reserve()` will cause issues in `Locker`

### Summary

`Listings::reserve()` doesn't delete the original `_listings` mapping of NFT token that was reserved, This will be a problem when the new owner unlock that protected Listing and deposit it into `Locker`, it will be stuck not being able to be redeem, swaped, swapped batch due to the the check [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L223)

### Root Cause

undeleted `_listings` mapping of NFT token after its reserved

### Internal pre-conditions

Token to be listed initially.

### External pre-conditions

Another user comes and reserve the listed token

### Attack Path

When user initially creates a listing [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L130-L166) it gets mapped to `_listings` map in the following function

```solidity
File: Listings.sol
242:     function _mapListings(CreateListing calldata _createListing, uint _tokenIds) private returns (uint tokensReceived_) {
243:         // Loop through our tokens
244:         for (uint i; i < _tokenIds; ++i) {
245:             // Create our initial listing and update the timestamp of the listing creation to now
246:             _listings[_createListing.collection][_createListing.tokenIds[i]] = Listing({
247:                 owner: _createListing.listing.owner,
248:                 created: uint40(block.timestamp),
249:                 duration: _createListing.listing.duration,
250:                 floorMultiple: _createListing.listing.floorMultiple
251:             });
252:         }
253: 
254:         // Our user will always receive one ERC20 per ERC721
255:         tokensReceived_ = _tokenIds * 1 ether;
256:     }
```

Now a user see this NFT and wants to `reserve()` it [Here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L690-L759) that doesn't delete the old listing and creates protected listing
```solidity
File: Listings.sol
737:         uint[] memory tokenIds = new uint[](1);
738:         tokenIds[0] = _tokenId;
739:         IProtectedListings.CreateListing[] memory createProtectedListing = new IProtectedListings.CreateListing[](1);
740:         createProtectedListing[0] = IProtectedListings.CreateListing({
741:             collection: _collection,
742:             tokenIds: tokenIds,
743:             listing: IProtectedListings.ProtectedListing({
744:                 owner: payable(address(this)),
745:                 tokenTaken: uint96(1 ether - _collateral),
746:                 checkpoint: 0 // Set in the `createListings` call
747:             })
748:         });
749: 
750:         // Create our listing, receiving the ERC20 into this contract
751:         protectedListings.createListings(createProtectedListing);
```

Now The user can unlock his protected Listing [Here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L287-L329)

For some reasons after he calls `Locker::deposit()` and deposit that NFT and gets minted a `collectionToken`

This token can never be redeemed again or swapped against and will stay stuck in `Locker` contract

This is more problematic due to the following scenario
1. we have in Locker 10 NFT and we have total supply of 10 `collectionToken` owned to 10 users
2. 9 users will call `redeem` to get 9 NFTs and the 10th NFT will be the one that is still shown in listings on `Listings` contract
3. when 10th user try to redeem that 10th NFT the redeem function will revert due to the following check `if (isListing(_collection, _tokenIds[i])) revert TokenIsListing(_tokenIds[i]);`


as said in summary section it can't be out thro any of `swap`, `swapBatch` and `redeem`

### Impact

Freeze of funds 

The NFT that its listing haven't been deleted will be frozen in `Locker` if it ever deposited into

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Delete the listings mapping after `reserve` called
