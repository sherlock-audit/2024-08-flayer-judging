# Again 0(zero) `checkpointIndex` is updated at `tstore` while creating a protected listings for the `first time`, leads to wrong creation of `_checkPoints`

## Summary
Again 0(zero) `checkpointIndex` is updated at `tstore` while creating a protected listings for the `first time`, leads to wrong creation of `_checkPoints`

## Vulnerability Detail
When a collection is listed/created using `protectedListings:createListings()` for the `first time` then checkpointIndex is 0 & a checkPoint is created using `_createCheckpoint()`, which returns the value of `index`. This returned value is stored in `tstore` at checkpointKey.
```solidity
function createListings(CreateListing[] calldata _createListings) public nonReentrant lockerNotPaused {
...
            // Update our checkpoint for the collection if it has not been done yet for
            // the listing collection.
            checkpointKey = keccak256(abi.encodePacked('checkpointIndex', listing.collection));
            assembly { checkpointIndex := tload(checkpointKey) }
            if (checkpointIndex == 0) {
@>             checkpointIndex = _createCheckpoint(listing.collection);
@>             assembly { tstore(checkpointKey, checkpointIndex) }
            }
...
    }
```
Lets see _createCheckpoint(), what it returns for listing a collection for the first time
```solidity
function _createCheckpoint(address _collection) internal returns (uint index_) {
        // Determine the index that will be created
@>      index_ = collectionCheckpoints[_collection].length;
...

        // If this is our first checkpoint, then our logic will be different as we won't have
        // a previous checkpoint to compare against and we don't want to underflow the index.
@>      if (index_ == 0) {
            // Calculate the current interest rate based on utilization
            (, uint _utilizationRate) = utilizationRate(_collection);

            // We don't have a previous checkpoint to calculate against, so we initiate our
            // first checkpoint with base data.
            collectionCheckpoints[_collection].push(
                Checkpoint({
                    compoundedFactor: locker.taxCalculator().calculateCompoundedFactor({
                        _previousCompoundedFactor: 1e18,
                        _utilizationRate: _utilizationRate,
                        _timePeriod: 0
                    }),
                    timestamp: block.timestamp
                })
            );

@>          return index_;
        }
...
    }
```
In the above code, `index_` is length of `collectionCheckpoints`, which will be `0(zero)` for the first time listing. If index_ == 0 then it initiate the first checkPoints with base data & returns the index_, which will be still `0(zero)`.

And again, 0(zero) value of index_ is set to tstore at `checkpointKey`, which means when other user will createListing for same collection, it will again call _createCheckpoint() because index at checkpointKey is 0(zero).

Now this is problem because at this time in _createCheckpoint(), index_ will be 1(because previously 1 checkPoint is pushed with base data). And when index_ is > 0, it creates new `_currentCheckpoint()` which calculates the `utilizationRate` based on `listingCount`. 

```solidity
function _createCheckpoint(address _collection) internal returns (uint index_) {
        // Determine the index that will be created
        index_ = collectionCheckpoints[_collection].length;
...
        // Get our new (current) checkpoint
@>      Checkpoint memory checkpoint = _currentCheckpoint(_collection);
...
    }
```

As this is 2nd time listing for the collection, which means `utilizationRate` should be calculated based on `updated` listingCount ie after tokens has been `deposited` to the Locker.sol contract & `collectionTokens` has been minted. But as we can see above createListing(), which creates _createCheckpoint() before tokens deposit & collectionTokens minting, because checkpointIndex is 0(zero). As result, wrong `checkPoint` will be created.

```solidity
function _currentCheckpoint(address _collection) internal view returns (Checkpoint memory checkpoint_) {
        // Calculate the current interest rate based on utilization
@>      (, uint _utilizationRate) = utilizationRate(_collection);
...
    }
```
```solidity
 function utilizationRate(address _collection) public view virtual returns (uint listingsOfType_, uint utilizationRate_) {
        // Get the count of active listings of the specified listing type
@>      listingsOfType_ = listingCount[_collection];

        // If we have listings of this type then we need to calculate the percentage, otherwise
        // we will just return a zero percent value.
        if (listingsOfType_ != 0) {
            ICollectionToken collectionToken = locker.collectionToken(_collection);

            // If we have no totalSupply, then we have a zero percent utilization
            uint totalSupply = collectionToken.totalSupply();
            if (totalSupply != 0) {
@>              utilizationRate_ = (listingsOfType_ * 1e36 * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination()) / totalSupply;
            }
        }
    }
```

## Impact
_createCheckpoint() will run `twice` due wrong setting of `checkpointIndex`, which will create a wrong checkPoint

Manual Review

## Recommendation
If it is first time listing a collection then `increase` the value of `index_` in _createCheckpoints() and then return it
```diff
 if (index_ == 0) {
            // Calculate the current interest rate based on utilization
            (, uint _utilizationRate) = utilizationRate(_collection);

            // We don't have a previous checkpoint to calculate against, so we initiate our
            // first checkpoint with base data.
            collectionCheckpoints[_collection].push(
                Checkpoint({
                    compoundedFactor: locker.taxCalculator().calculateCompoundedFactor({
                        _previousCompoundedFactor: 1e18,
                        _utilizationRate: _utilizationRate,
                        _timePeriod: 0
                    }),
                    timestamp: block.timestamp
                })
            );

-            return index_;
+           return index_++;
        }
```
