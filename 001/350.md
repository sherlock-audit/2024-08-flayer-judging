# A collection will not be shutdown in an edge case

## Summary
If we shutdown a collection once and start it again, users will not be able to start voting for the shutdown the second time
## Vulnerability Detail
When a voting for the sunset of a collection is started the _collectionParams global mapping will save the votes. 
However when the collection is executed the _collectionParams `shutdownVotes` parameter for the current collection is not reset back to 0. The `Locker.sol` contract will still allow the creation of another instance of the same collection, however because the mapping is not reset and the old shutdownVotes will still apply for the new collection causing `start` to revert here:

## Impact`
DOS of the shutdown functionality for the collection that has been shutdown once - Medium

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Reset the shutdown votes after execution. However you will need to implement another flag or keep the previous shutdown of the collection stored in another place so that the new shutdown does not override it.
