# missing revoking permissions when vault is removed.

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
here we see what is the LockerManager contract:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/LockerManager.sol#L10-L13

so the contract does not handle scenarios where a vault might be removed. If a vault associated with a manager is removed from the system, the corresponding manager might still retain approval to manage tokens. This can lead to situations where an unauthorized manager still has access to vault tokens.
## Impact
approved manager may continue to have permissions they should no longer have, leading to unauthorized token operations.
## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
implement a function that revokes all permissions from the manager when a vault is removed.
