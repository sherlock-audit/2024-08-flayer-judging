# Premanently locking the nfts on Rift contarcts in case send messages reverts


## Summary
Impact : high, Loss of funds during cross chain transfer of funds.
Likelihood : low to medium

## Vulnerability Detail
The corss domain messengers used in both L1 an L2 to send the message to the destination chain says  `Note that if the call always reverts, then the message will be unrelayable, and any ETH sent will be permanently locked.`

We don't move any ETH, but messages are sent between l1 to l2 (to claim royalties, lock l2 tokens and release the locked l1 tokens). There is no issue in royalty claiming flow if the destination tx fails, you can retry again.


But, lets take a flow where 5 BAYC are locked in `InfernalRiftBelow.returnFromThreshold` and it calls `L2_CROSS_DOMAIN_MESSENGER.sendMessage` to release the locked BAYC on l1's rift above contract. If the `InfernalRiftAbove.returnFromTheThreshold` fails, then the tokens locked in L2 rift below are locked there permanently, and the unlocking of the l1 tokens also revert all the time, hence its a loss of funds.

The `InfernalRiftAbove.returnFromTheThreshold` can revert due to many reasons, 
 - Gas limit was not enough this time, user error input, or the erc721/er1155 collection did update to the contract or it was a particualar transaction that required more than the normal condition. (happens if many 0 slots are charged to non zero.) Even if you rule it as user error, there are flows where user can't be in control of  passing the sufficient gas limit. Just the likelihood is low.
 - `recipient` receiver didn't accept the safe callback check `on erc1155 received` call.
 - Or the number of `idsToCross` array was huge and the gas left became 0.


All bridge integrated protocols will have a retry/cancel message, where if the message is not hit on the destination chain, the message can be returned or canceled. In this case, if l1 unlock fails, then the user can come and cancel the message to release the locked tokens back in L2 itself. Or retry the message with new gas limit.

## Impact
If the cross-chain send messages fail, then the locked tokens in Rift contracts can never be unlocked due to the lack of retry/cancel message features. So loss of funds with a low likelhood of cross-chain message reverts, giving it medium

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a handle message function, where the user can retry or cancel his message and unlock the tokens in case his l1/l2 messages fail.
