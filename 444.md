# donateAmount uses a fixed amount0 and does not consider the impact of currencyFlipped

## Summary
donateAmount uses a fixed amount0 and does not consider the impact of currencyFlipped
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `_distributeFees` function of the `UniswapImplementation.sol` contract,the current code assumes that `donateAmount` comes from` _poolFees[poolId].amount0` and does not take into account `currencyFlipped`. If `currencyFlipped` == `true`, `amount1` should actually be donated instead of `amount0`, otherwise it will result in incorrect funds allocation.
## Impact
If `currencyFlipped == true`, `donateAmount` should come from `amount1` instead of `amount0`. The current logic uses `amount0` directly, causing funds to be allocated to the wrong currency in the case of a flip. For example, the contract actually requires a donation of `amount1` tokens, but due to a logic problem, it donates `amount0`, which will result in the expected fees not being donated to the correct asset pool.

```solidity
    function _distributeFees(PoolKey memory _poolKey) internal {
        // If the pool is not initialized, we prevent this from raising an exception and bricking hooks
        PoolId poolId = _poolKey.toId();
        PoolParams memory poolParams = _poolParams[poolId];

        if (!poolParams.initialized) {
            return;
        }

        // Get the amount of the native token available to donate
        uint donateAmount = _poolFees[poolId].amount0;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
When getting `donateAmount`, you should decide whether to use `amount0` or `amount1` based on `currencyFlipped`:
```solidity
uint donateAmount = poolParams.currencyFlipped ? _poolFees[poolId].amount1 : _poolFees[poolId].amount0;
```
