# Unprotected initializer functions will expose contract to unauthorized state changes

## Summary
Certain initializer functions in the smart contracts are not protected by access control modifiers. This oversight could allow unauthorized users or contracts to execute initialization logic, potentially altering the contract's state or functionality in an unintended manner.

## Vulnerability Detail
Initializer functions are crucial for setting up the initial state of contracts. When these functions are not protected by access control mechanisms, they can be called by unauthorized parties. This is particularly concerning if the functions perform critical state changes or setup operations.

Several instances in the contracts include initializer functions like `initializeCollection` and `_guardInitializeOwner`, which lack proper protection:

- `initializeCollection` functions in contracts such as `BaseImplementation.sol` and `UniswapImplementation.sol`.
- `_guardInitializeOwner` functions in contracts like `CollectionToken.sol`, `Listings.sol`, and others.

These functions are supposed to be called only once during contract deployment or initialization, but without protection, they could be exploited to manipulate the contract state.

## Impact
**- Unauthorized State Changes:** Without proper protection, unauthorized parties may call initializer functions, potentially changing the contract's state in ways not intended by the developers.
**- Compromised Contract Integrity:** The contract could be left in an inconsistent or insecure state if critical initialization steps are altered.
**- Potential Exploits:** Attackers could exploit unprotected initializers to gain control over contract functionality or data.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add Access Control Modifiers: Protect initializer functions with appropriate access control modifiers to ensure that only authorized parties can execute them. For example, use `onlyOwner` or `initializer` modifiers.
