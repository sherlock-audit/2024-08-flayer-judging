# LinearRangeCurve cannot be used as bonding curve when creates Sudoswap pool

## Summary

[LinearRangeCurve](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/lib/LinearRangeCurve.sol#L17C10-L17C26) cannot be used as bonding curve when creates Sudoswap pool.

## Vulnerability Detail

When collection shutdown is executed, a Sudoswap pool is created to liquidate an array of tokenIds from the specified collection. 

[CollectionShutdown.sol#L262-L263](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L262-L263):
```solidity
        // Map our collection to a newly created pair
        address pool = _createSudoswapPool(collection, _tokenIds);
```

When creating the pool, a bonding curve for the pair to price NFTs should be specified, `LinearRangeCurve` is expected to be used as the bonding curve, however, Sudoswap only allows whitelisted curve contract to be used, as mentioned in the [Doc](https://docs.sudoswap.xyz/reference/pricing/):
> sudoswap V2 currently has four whitelisted bonding curves.

And in the deployed [LSSVMPairFactory](https://basescan.org/address/0x605145D263482684590f630E9e581B21E4938eb8#code#F1#L127) contract:
```solidity
       * @param _bondingCurve The bonding curve for the pair to price NFTs, must be whitelisted
```

## Impact

Transaction will revert when create Sudoswap pool.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Refactor to use the whitelisted bonding curve contracts.
