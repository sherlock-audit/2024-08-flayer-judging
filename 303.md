# Missing checks for address(0) will allow assignment of invalid addresses to state variables

## Summary
Several instances in the smart contracts are missing checks for the `address(0)` value when assigning values to address state variables. This oversight could lead to invalid or uninitialized addresses being assigned, which might cause unintended behavior or vulnerabilities in the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
When assigning addresses to state variables, it's crucial to ensure that the assigned address is not `address(0)`, which is often used to represent an uninitialized or invalid address. Failing to perform this check can lead to situations where the contract behaves unexpectedly or insecurely.

## Impact
**Invalid Contract Interactions:** Assigning address(0) to state variables can result in invalid interactions with contracts, as function calls or operations involving these addresses would fail or produce unexpected results.

## Recommendation
**Add Address Checks:** Implement checks to ensure that the address being assigned is not `address(0)`. Use require statements or equivalent checks to validate addresses before assigning them to state variables.
