# Send ether with call instead of transfer

## Summary
Use call instead of transfer to send ether. And return value must be checked if sending ether is successful or not. Sending ether with the transfer is no longer recommended.
## Vulnerability Detail
 function claim(address _beneficiary) public nonReentrant {
        // Ensure that the beneficiary has an amount available to claim. We don't revert
        // at this point as it could open an external protocol to DoS.
        uint amount = beneficiaryFees[_beneficiary];
        if (amount == 0) return;

        // We cannot make a direct claim if the beneficiary is a pool
        if (beneficiaryIsPool) revert BeneficiaryPoolCannotClaim();

        // Reduce the amount of fees allocated to the `beneficiary` for the token. This
        // helps to prevent reentrancy attacks.
        beneficiaryFees[_beneficiary] = 0;

        // Claim ETH equivalent available to the beneficiary
      @>>  IERC20(nativeToken).transfer(_beneficiary, amount);
        emit BeneficiaryFeesClaimed(_beneficiary, amount);
    }
