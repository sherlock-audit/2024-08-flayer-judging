# Some NFTs are pausable and can stuck the rest of our colelctions

### Summary

Many NFTs have passable functionality, like Axie Infinity, which can brick the rest of our NFTs in the current batch if we transfer them together.

Example:
1. Alice has a huge collection on ARB
2. She transfers 20 of her NFTs back to ETH mainnet, one of which is passable
3. The collection is paused, so when  InfernalRiftAbove tries to transfer them back to Alice the TX reverts, bricking the reset of her NFTs until that one single NFT gets unpaused

This specific part of the code is the issue.

```solidity
            for (uint j; j < numIds; ++j) {
                if (amountsToCross[i][j] == 0) {
                    IERC721Metadata(collectionAddresses[i]).transferFrom(address(this), recipient, idsToCross[i][j]);
                } else {
                    IERC1155MetadataURI(collectionAddresses[i]).safeTransferFrom(address(this), recipient, idsToCross[i][j], amountsToCross[i][j], '');
                }
            }
```
Notice how the system implements push over pull, meaning that if 1 NFT reverts due to some reason the whole TX reverts.

### Root Cause

The system implementing batched transfers in a way that if 1 NFT reverts the whole TX reverts.

### Internal pre-conditions

None, the system is designed in a way for this issue to occur

### External pre-conditions

One NFT to be paused

### Attack Path

1. User sends 20 NFTs to the other chain
2. One of them is paused
3. The TX revert on the other chain, bricking all 20 NFTs for unknown amount of time

### Impact

1. Core contract functionality is broken
2. Users get their NFTs stuck for unknown amount of time

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Design a map for all not transferred NFTs and allow users to pull them separately, aka use pull and not push.
