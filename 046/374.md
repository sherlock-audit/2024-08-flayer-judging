# Compound interest is lost when liquidating an unhealthy, protected listing

## Summary
When the `unlockPrice()` surpasses the `MAX_PROTECTED_TOKEN_AMOUNT` (up to **95%** in `ProtectedListings`), the compounded fee over this value is **lost**, and the protocol ends up in **bad debt**.

## Vulnerability Detail
`MAX_PROTECTED_TOKEN_AMOUNT = 0.95 ether;` and `KEEPER_REWARD = 0.05 ether;` are defined in `ProtectedListings`.

In order to call `liquidateProtectedListing()` for a listing, we need the `getProtectedListingHealth()` function to return a **negative collateral value**.

```solidity
    function liquidateProtectedListing(address _collection, uint _tokenId) public {
        int collateral = getProtectedListingHealth(_collection, _tokenId);
@>>   if (collateral >= 0) revert ListingStillHasCollateral();
```

This happens when `MAX_PROTECTED_TOKEN_AMOUNT - unlockPrice < 0`. The unlock price is calculated when the borrowed amount (i.e., the amount the owner of the NFT has borrowed in `CT` tokens + the compounded interest) exceeds `0.95e18`.  
**Note**: 1e18 or 1 ether represents 100% of `1 CT`.

```solidity
    function getProtectedListingHealth(address _collection, uint _tokenId) public view returns (int) {
@>>     return int(MAX_PROTECTED_TOKEN_AMOUNT) - int(unlockPrice(_collection, _tokenId));
    }
```

In the [`liquidateProtectedListing()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L429-L484) function, we have this calculation:

```solidity
        uint remainingCollateral = (1 ether - listing.tokenTaken - KEEPER_REWARD) * 10 ** denomination;
        if (remainingCollateral > 0) {
            IBaseImplementation implementation = locker.implementation();
            collectionToken.approve(address(implementation), remainingCollateral);
            implementation.depositFees(_collection, 0, remainingCollateral);
        }
```

This essentially deposits the remaining amounts into the `depositFees()` in the `UniswapV4Implementation`, which is then distributed to the liquidity providers as rewards.

The problem is that if we call `liquidateProtectedListing()`, the protocol will **always end up in bad debt**.  
For example, if `unlockPrice = 0.96 ether`, then **0.01 ether (~1%)** of the unlock price will not be retrieved from the Flayer protocol.

Letâ€™s say the owner has taken out **0.5 CT**, and `KEEPER_REWARD` is fixed at **0.05 ether**, so the amounts received are:
`uint remainingCollateral = (1 ether - 0.5 ether - 0.05 ether)`, which equals **0.45 ether**. The **0.01 ether is lost**.

This behavior can be tested via the `test_CanLiquidateProtectedListing()` test that already exists. Simply adjust the "warp" time to increase the delta returned from `getProtectedListingHealth()`, since `unlockPrice` will be higher:

```diff
        // Warp forward to a point at which the collateral available is negative
-        vm.warp(block.timestamp + LIQUIDATION_TIME);
+        vm.warp(block.timestamp + LIQUIDATION_TIME + 3000 days);
        assertLt(protectedListings.getProtectedListingHealth(address(erc721a), _tokenId), 0);
```

However, when running `forge test --match-test test_CanLiquidateProtectedListing  -vvvv`, our balance asserts will still be valid, and the test will pass, as these fees are not factored in.

## Impact

This could have a **significant impact** if `liquidateProtectedListing()` was called when the utilization rate was **over 0.8**.

When the utilization rate is high (above the **0.8 kink**), the compound interest increases drastically, as defined in the **TaxCalculator** contract.

We could see **rapid changes** in the `unlockPrice`.

### Example Delta Computation:
**Preconditions**:  
- Lockbox is created and an NFT is deposited.
- 0.5 CT is borrowed. (maximum borrow is 0.95CT)

**Flow**:
- `unlockPrice` reaches **1.05 ether**
- `liquidateProtectedListing()` is called
  - The KEEPER receives **0.05 CT** of the **0.5 CT** left. Now the contract "holds" **0.45 CT**
  - Using the `remainingCollateral` formula, we get: `(1 ether - 0.5 ether - 0.05 ether) = 0.45 CT` which will be distributed for fees from the interest.  The `unlockPrice` was **1.05 ether** and the protocol ends up loosing part of the compounded interest, in this case he gave 0.05 as reward, but more importantly lost the 0.05 accrued over the 1 ether.
  
- A **Dutch auction** is created in **Listings.sol** with 4x floorMultiplier and 4 days duration.
- **Ownership** of the Dutch auction is transferred back to the owner.

This **bad debt** could be avoided if the NFT was valuable, as buyers might purchase it for more than the floor price in the Dutch auction. However, the protocol won't benefit because ownership is transferred back to the liquidated owner. And if the NFT is sold over the floor price of 1CT, the owner will receive compensation. 

The protocol is **not prioritizing recovering its interest fees** from the auction and thus ends up in bad debt. 

## Tools Used

**Manual Review**

## Recommendation
A potential solution is to allow the **ProtectedListings** contract to retain custody of the auction, so it can receive the **additional CT** from the Dutch auction if the NFT is valuable and sells for over 1 CT. This way, the debt can be covered first, then the remainder can be distributed to the owner and the KEEPER.  
(Alternatively, the KEEPER reward could be kept at the creation stage, if preferred.)
