# Maximum borrowable amount in protected listings should be lower

### Summary

_No response_

### Root Cause

When the health of a protected listing is negative, the position can be liquidated. The health is determined by [getProtectedListingHealth()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L497) by subtracting the current price to unlock the protected listing from `0.95 ether`:
```solidity
return int(MAX_PROTECTED_TOKEN_AMOUNT) - int(unlockPrice(_collection, _tokenId));
```
The protocol allows users to take up to `0.95e18` tokens when creating a protected listing, which means that as soon as a protected listing is created [getProtectedListingHealth()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L497) can return `0`, and the block after it will return a negative value allowing the listing to be liquidated almost immediately.

### Attack Path

An attacker can take advantage of this to list an NFT as a dutch auction without paying taxes on it:

1. Create a protected listing and borrow `0.95e18` tokens
2. Wait a block and liquidate his own listing, the attacker will get `0.05e18` tokens for this. The attacker collected `1e18` tokens already, which is the same amount he would get if he deposited the NFT as a floor item
3. The NFT is now liquidated and listed as a 4 days long dutch auction with a 400 floor multiplier


### Impact

- Users can get liquidated the block after they list their NFT if they borrow `0.95e18` tokens
- An attacker can list an NFT as a 4 days dutch auction with a 400 floor multiplier while avoiding paying taxes

### PoC

### Mitigation

Add a buffer before liquidating is possible, as an example limit the maximum amount of tokens allowed to borrow to `0.9e18`.
