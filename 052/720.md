# Duplicate Listing Vulnerability Allows Auction Avoidance in `Listing ` contract

## Summary
The Listings contract lacks a mechanism to check for existing listings when creating new ones. This oversight allows users to overwrite existing listings, resetting critical parameters and circumventing the auction process.
## Vulnerability Detail
The ` _validateCreateListing` function in `createListings` function does not verify if a listing already exists for a given token ID. Consequently, in `maplistings` function  users can repeatedly overwrite listings, resetting the created timestamp and extending the listing duration without additional pre-payment. This manipulation prevents the automatic transition to a dutch auction when the pre-pay balance expires.
## Impact
Auction Avoidance: Users can indefinitely delay the dutch auction process, undermining the contract's pricing mechanisms.
Market Distortion: By avoiding auctions, users can maintain inflated prices, disrupting market dynamics and fairness.
Integrity Compromise: The intended "set and forget" model is compromised, as users can manipulate listings to avoid consequences of mispricing.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement Existence Check: Before creating a new listing, verify if a listing already exists for the token ID. If it does, prevent overwriting without cancellation or fulfillment.
Enforce Pre-Pay Expiry: Ensure that any modification to a listing requires recalculation and adjustment of the pre-pay balance to prevent indefinite extensions without additional payment.
