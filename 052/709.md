# Potential Duplicate Listing Vulnerability in `createListings` Function

## Summary
The `_validateCreateListing` function in  `createListings` function in the `Listings contract` lacks a check to determine if a listing already exists for a given token ID. This oversight can lead to potential issues, such as duplicate listings, which may result in unintended behavior or exploitation.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `createListings` function processes each CreateListing struct without verifying if a listing for the specified token ID already exists in the _listings mapping. This could allow users to create multiple listings for the same token ID, leading to inconsistencies in the contract's state.
## Impact
State Inconsistency: Multiple listings for the same token ID can lead to confusion and errors in the contract's logic, affecting the integrity of the listings.
Potential Exploitation: While direct financial exploitation may not be possible, the existence of duplicate listings could be leveraged in unforeseen ways, potentially impacting the contract's functionality.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement Existence Check: Before creating a new listing, check if a listing already exists for the given token ID in the _listings mapping. If a listing exists, revert the transaction to prevent duplicates.
