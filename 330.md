# Due to the delay in converting token1 fees into token0 (WETH) fees in beforeSwap(), an attacker can execute a sandwich attack to gain risk-free profits.


## Summary
Due to the delay in converting token1 fees into token0 (WETH) fees in beforeSwap(), an attacker can execute a sandwich attack to gain risk-free profits.
## Vulnerability Detail
```javascript
 /**
     * Before a swap is made, we pull in the dynamic pool fee that we have set to ensure it is
     * applied to the tx.
     *
@>>     * We also see if we have any token1 fee tokens that we can use to fill the swap before it
     * hits the Uniswap pool. This prevents the pool from being affected and reduced gas costs.
     * This also allows us to benefit from the Uniswap routing infrastructure.
     *
     * This frontruns UniSwap to sell undesired token amounts from our fees into desired tokens
     * ahead of our fee distribution. This acts as a partial orderbook to remove impact against
     * our pool.

```
If the fee is in token1, it will not be directly distributed to LP holders. Instead, it will wait until someone needs to buy token1, at which point token1 will first be swapped into token0. The distribution will only occur the next time _distributeFees() is triggered.
```javascript
    function _distributeFees(PoolKey memory _poolKey) internal {
        // If the pool is not initialized, we prevent this from raising an exception and bricking hooks
        PoolId poolId = _poolKey.toId();
        PoolParams memory poolParams = _poolParams[poolId];

        if (!poolParams.initialized) {
            return;
        }

        // Get the amount of the native token available to donate
@>>        uint donateAmount = _poolFees[poolId].amount0;

        // Ensure that the collection has sufficient fees available
        if (donateAmount < donateThresholdMin) {
            return;
        }

        // Reduce our available fees
        _poolFees[poolId].amount0 = 0;

        // Split the donation amount between beneficiary and LP
        (uint poolFee, uint beneficiaryFee) = feeSplit(donateAmount);

        // Make our donation to the pool, with the beneficiary amount remaining in the
        // contract ready to be claimed.
        if (poolFee > 0) {
            // Determine whether the currency is flipped to determine which is the donation side
@>>            (uint amount0, uint amount1) = poolParams.currencyFlipped ? (uint(0), poolFee) : (poolFee, uint(0));
@>>            BalanceDelta delta = poolManager.donate(_poolKey, amount0, amount1, '');

            // Check the native delta amounts that we need to transfer from the contract
            if (delta.amount0() < 0) {
                _pushTokens(_poolKey.currency0, uint128(-delta.amount0()));
            }

            if (delta.amount1() < 0) {
                _pushTokens(_poolKey.currency1, uint128(-delta.amount1()));
            }

            emit PoolFeesDistributed(poolParams.collection, poolFee, 0);
        }

        // Check if we have beneficiary fees to distribute
        if (beneficiaryFee != 0) {
            // If our beneficiary is a Flayer pool, then we make a direct call
            if (beneficiaryIsPool) {
                // As we don't want to make a transfer call, we just extrapolate
                // the required logic from the `depositFees` function.
                _poolFees[_poolKeys[beneficiary].toId()].amount0 += beneficiaryFee;
                emit PoolFeesReceived(beneficiary, beneficiaryFee, 0);
            }
            // Otherwise, we can just update the escrow allocation
            else {
                beneficiaryFees[beneficiary] += beneficiaryFee;
                emit BeneficiaryFeesReceived(beneficiary, beneficiaryFee);
            }
        }
    }

```
From _distributeFees(), we can also see that only token0 (WETH) is distributed to LP holders. token1 accumulates until the next time a user needs token1, at which point it is traded into token0 and added to amount0.

However, the majority of our fees are earned through token1, such as in the Listings contract with functions like fillListings(), cancelListings(), modifyListings(), and _resolveListingTax(), among others.
```javascript

 function fillListings(FillListingsParams calldata params) public nonReentrant lockerNotPaused {
     //--------skip---------
        uint fillFee = _tload(FILL_FEE);
        if (fillFee != 0) {
            _collectionToken.approve(address(locker.implementation()), fillFee);
@>>            locker.implementation().depositFees(collection, 0, fillFee);
            assembly { tstore(FILL_FEE, 0) }
        }

    }


  function cancelListings(address _collection, uint[] memory _tokenIds, bool _payTaxWithEscrow) public lockerNotPaused {
      //------skip--------
        // Give some partial fees to the LP
        if (fees != 0) {
            collectionToken.approve(address(locker.implementation()), fees);
@>>            locker.implementation().depositFees(_collection, 0, fees);
        }

    }
```
Additionally, this includes the ProtectedListings contract’s liquidateProtectedListing() function, among others.
```javascript
  function liquidateProtectedListing(address _collection, uint _tokenId) public lockerNotPaused listingExists(_collection, _tokenId) {
        //----skip------
        // Send the remaining tokens to {Locker} implementation as fees
        uint remainingCollateral = (1 ether - listing.tokenTaken - KEEPER_REWARD) * 10 ** denomination;
        if (remainingCollateral > 0) {
            IBaseImplementation implementation = locker.implementation();
            collectionToken.approve(address(implementation), remainingCollateral);
@>>            implementation.depositFees(_collection, 0, remainingCollateral);
        }

    }
```
Attack scenario:

	1.	The attacker notices a large accumulation of token1 fees.
	2.	The attacker monitors for a swap transaction where token1 is being exchanged for token0.
	3.	The attacker frontruns this swap transaction by providing a large amount of token0-token1 liquidity to the pool.
	4.	After the swap is completed, the attacker removes the liquidity they just added. The attacker can then collect the corresponding portion of the fees in token0.

Because during the liquidity removal callback, the distribution of token0 fees is triggered.
```javascript
function beforeRemoveLiquidity(address sender, PoolKey calldata key, IPoolManager.ModifyLiquidityParams calldata params, bytes calldata hookData) public override onlyByPoolManager returns (bytes4 selector_) {
        // Distribute fees to our LPs
        _distributeFees(key);

        // Set our return selector
        selector_ = IHooks.beforeRemoveLiquidity.selector;
    }
```

Since this attack method carries no risk, the attacker can borrow large amounts of capital to capture the majority of the fees and repeat the attack multiple times.

## Impact
he attacker steals the majority of the fees through a sandwich attack, resulting in losses for the LP holders.
