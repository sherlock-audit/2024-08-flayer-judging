# Lack of check `numIds != amountsToCross[i].length` leads to panic Error `0x32` array out-of-bounds access.

### Summary

function `crossTheThreshold1155()` is used to send the tokens from L1 to L2.

In below code snippet we can see that there is no check of the numIds and amountToCross 

```solidity
  for (uint i; i < numCollections; ++i) {
            // Cache values needed
            numIds = params.idsToCross[i].length;

            
            collectionAddress = params.collectionAddresses[i];

            erc1155 = IERC1155MetadataURI(collectionAddress);

            // Go through each NFT, set its URI and escrow it
            uris = new string[](numIds);

            for (uint j; j < numIds; ++j) {
                // Ensure we have a valid amount passed (TODO: Is this needed?)
                tokenAmount = params.amountsToCross[i][j];
                if (tokenAmount == 0) {
                    revert InvalidERC1155Amount();
                }

                uris[j] = erc1155.uri(params.idsToCross[i][j]);
                erc1155.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), params.idsToCross[i][j], params.amountsToCross[i][j], '');
            }

            // Set up payload
            package[i] = Package({
                chainId: block.chainid,
                collectionAddress: collectionAddress,
                ids: params.idsToCross[i],
                amounts: params.amountsToCross[i],
                uris: uris,
                royaltyBps: _getCollectionRoyalty(collectionAddress, params.idsToCross[i][0]),
                name: '',
                symbol: ''
            });
        }
```

The above loop which is used to allocate the package struct it have a check to only whether the tokenAmount is zero or not but not Token Ids. According the ERC1155 the amounts should equal to Token Ids before transfer happens.

### Root Cause

No Check of the `numIds != amountsToCross[i].length` in crossThreshold1155 function leads to panic error which could dos the normal process and loss of funds.

### Internal pre-conditions

If the user try to sends bulk transcation if they are any mismatch of the ids and amounts it will leads to exception error which disturbs the normal process of other transaction.

### External pre-conditions

Internal pre-condition applies here.

### Attack Path

1. User can send the tokens wise in batch L1 to L2 and L2 to L1 in same transction.
2. If the length of the AmountsToCross and IdsToCross is not equal then the amounts other than mis match ids will get stuck because of the Bridge Panic error.


### Impact

1. Loss of the tokens.

### PoC

```solidity
function test_Payable() public {

        // Mint a range of ERC1155 to our user
        l1NFT1155.mint(address(this), 0, 5);
        l1NFT1155.mint(address(this), 1, 5);
        l1NFT1155.mint(address(this), 2, 5);

        // Approve all to be used
        l1NFT1155.setApprovalForAll(address(riftAbove), true);

        // Set our collection
        address[] memory collections = new address[](1);
        collections[0] = address(l1NFT1155);

        // Set our IDs
        uint[][] memory idList = new uint[][](1);
        uint[] memory ids = new uint[](4); // @audit check here
        ids[0] = 0;
        ids[1] = 1;
        ids[2] = 2;
        idList[0] = ids;


        // Set our amounts
        uint[][] memory amountList = new uint[][](1);
        uint[] memory amounts = new uint[](3);//@audit check here

        amounts[0] = 4;
        amounts[1] = 5;
        amounts[2] = 1;
        amountList[0] = amounts;

        // Set our domain messenger
        mockPortalAndMessenger.setXDomainMessenger(address(riftAbove));
        uint256 BeforeGas = gasleft();
        console.log("Before gas",BeforeGas);
        // Cross the threshold!
        riftAbove.crossTheThreshold1155(
            _buildCrossThreshold1155Params(collections, idList, amountList, address(this), 0)
        );
}
```

Paste the above code in RiftTest.sol and run to considered this issue.

### Mitigation

Add the below check to mitigate in crossTheThreshold1155 function.
```solidity
if(numIds != params.amountsToCross[i].length) revert("something is wrong");
```
This issue is completely different from the issue panic error overFlow and Under flow error.

Implement the above check in below functions which are also affected.

InfernalRiftAbove.sol
returnFromTheThreshold()
crossTheThreshold1155()
crossTheThreshold()

InfernalRiftBelow.sol
thresholdCross()
returnFromThreshold()
