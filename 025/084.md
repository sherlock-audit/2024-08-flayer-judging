# Unchecked ERC20 Transfer Result in `claim` Function Leading to Potential Loss of Funds

## Summary
The `claim` function on `BaseImplementation` fails to check the return value of the `IERC20(nativeToken).transfer` function. This can lead to a scenario where the token transfer fails silently, but the recipient's balance is reset to zero, leading to potential loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the absence of a check on the success of the token transfer operation. The `IERC20.transfer` function is called without verifying its return value, which is crucial for ensuring that the transfer was successful.
```solidity
164:     function claim(address _beneficiary) public nonReentrant {
---
167:         uint amount = beneficiaryFees[_beneficiary];
168:         if (amount == 0) return;
169: 
---
171:         if (beneficiaryIsPool) revert BeneficiaryPoolCannotClaim();
172: 
---
175:         beneficiaryFees[_beneficiary] = 0;
176: 
---
178:@=>      IERC20(nativeToken).transfer(_beneficiary, amount);
179:         emit BeneficiaryFeesClaimed(_beneficiary, amount);
180:     }
```

## Impact
If the transfer fails for any reason, the recipient's balance is still set to zero, effectively resulting in the loss of the funds that were supposed to be transferred.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a check on the transfer's return value.
```diff
function claim(address _beneficiary) public nonReentrant {
    uint amount = beneficiaryFees[_beneficiary];
    if (amount == 0) return;

    if (beneficiaryIsPool) revert BeneficiaryPoolCannotClaim();

    beneficiaryFees[_beneficiary] = 0;

    // Claim ETH equivalent available to the beneficiary
+   bool success = IERC20(nativeToken).transfer(_beneficiary, amount);
+   require(success, "Transfer failed");

-   IERC20(nativeToken).transfer(_beneficiary, amount);
    emit BeneficiaryFeesClaimed(_beneficiary, amount);
}
```
