# `BaseImplementation::claim(...)`  can revert causing beneficiary fees to be stuck

### Summary

The `claim(...)` function uses `transfer(...)` to send ETH to `beneficiary` and this can prevent the `beneficiary` from receiving it due fees

### Root Cause

The [`claim()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/BaseImplementation.sol#L178) uses the solidity `transfer(...)` function to send ETH to `beneficiary` this can cause the function to revert if the `beneficiary`  is a multisig wallet or a contract that has additional logic in its `receive(...)` function

```solidity
File: BaseImplementation.sol
164:     function claim(address _beneficiary) public nonReentrant {
SNIP      ............
176: 
177:         // Claim ETH equivalent available to the beneficiary
178:   @>    IERC20(nativeToken).transfer(_beneficiary, amount);
179:         emit BeneficiaryFeesClaimed(_beneficiary, amount);
180:     }

```
