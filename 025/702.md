# Balance Reset in Beneficiary Fee Claim Function Leads to Potential Fund Loss

## Summary

A critical vulnerability has been identified in the claim function of the `BaseImplementation` contract. When a beneficiary claims their fees, the entire balance is set to zero instead of subtracting the claimed amount, potentially leading to loss of funds for beneficiaries. This issue is particularly concerning given the contract's role in fee distribution within the Flayer protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the claim function of BaseImplementation.sol, after checking the available amount for a beneficiary, the code sets the entire balance to zero:

```solidity
    beneficiaryFees[_beneficiary] = 0;

```

This occurs before the transfer of funds, effectively resetting the balance regardless of the amount transferred. The function is designed to allow beneficiaries to claim their accumulated fees, but this implementation flaw could result in unintended loss of funds.


## Impact

This vulnerability can lead to significant financial losses for beneficiaries within the Flayer ecosystem. If a beneficiary has accumulated fees over time and only claims a portion, they will lose access to the remaining unclaimed balance. This could result in:

1. Direct financial losses for beneficiaries
2. Disruption of the fee distribution mechanism in the Flayer protocol
3. Loss of trust in the protocol, potentially affecting user adoption and overall protocol health
4. Given that Flayer is designed to operate on the Base network, as mentioned in the README.md, this issue could have wide-reaching implications for the protocol's operations on that chain.


**Code Snippet**
```solidity
    function claim(address _beneficiary) public nonReentrant {
    // Ensure that the beneficiary has an amount available to claim. We don't revert
    // at this point as it could open an external protocol to DoS.
    uint amount = beneficiaryFees[_beneficiary];
    if (amount == 0) return;

    // We cannot make a direct claim if the beneficiary is a pool
    if (beneficiaryIsPool) revert BeneficiaryPoolCannotClaim();

    // Reduce the amount of fees allocated to the `beneficiary` for the token. This
    // helps to prevent reentrancy attacks.
    beneficiaryFees[_beneficiary] = 0; //@audit this is meant to reduce the amount but it sets it as 0. user loses remaining balance

    // Claim ETH equivalent available to the beneficiary
    IERC20(nativeToken).transfer(_beneficiary, amount);
    emit BeneficiaryFeesClaimed(_beneficiary, amount);
}
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation

Modify the claim function to only subtract the claimed amount from the beneficiary's balance:

```solidity
    function claim(address _beneficiary) public nonReentrant {
    uint amount = beneficiaryFees[_beneficiary];
    if (amount == 0) return;

    if (beneficiaryIsPool) revert BeneficiaryPoolCannotClaim();

    beneficiaryFees[_beneficiary] -= amount;

    IERC20(nativeToken).transfer(_beneficiary, amount);
    emit BeneficiaryFeesClaimed(_beneficiary, amount);
}
```


Additionally, consider implementing a partial claim feature to allow beneficiaries to claim only a portion of their accumulated fees:

```solidity
    function partialClaim(address _beneficiary, uint _amount) public nonReentrant {
    uint availableAmount = beneficiaryFees[_beneficiary];
    require(_amount <= availableAmount, "Insufficient funds");

    if (beneficiaryIsPool) revert BeneficiaryPoolCannotClaim();

    beneficiaryFees[_beneficiary] -= _amount;

    IERC20(nativeToken).transfer(_beneficiary, _amount);
    emit BeneficiaryFeesClaimed(_beneficiary, _amount);
}
```
