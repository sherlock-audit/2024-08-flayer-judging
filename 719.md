# user can create listing with dust amount to block collection shutdown

### Summary

User can create listing with dust amount to block collection shutdown because interest will accreu slowly keeping the position healthy for a long time

### Root Cause

[`CollectionShutdown::execute(..)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L241) cannot be called when  there are still active protected listings in the protocol, Hence a user can create listing with a dust amount and leave it for as long as possible considering that the position will be healthy for a long time 

```solidity
    function _hasListings(address _collection) internal view returns (bool) {
        IListings listings = locker.listings();
        if (address(listings) != address(0)) {
            if (listings.listingCount(_collection) != 0) {
                return true;
            }


            // Check that no protected listings currently exist
            IProtectedListings protectedListings = listings.protectedListings();
            if (address(protectedListings) != address(0)) {
 @>             if (protectedListings.listingCount(_collection) != 0) {
                    return true;
                }
```

As seen below, the [health check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L500) for a position calls [`unlockPrice(...)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L612-L616) which in turn calls [compound](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/TaxCalculator.sol#L90) to calculate the 


```solidity
    function getProtectedListingHealth(address _collection, uint _tokenId) public view listingExists(_collection, _tokenId) returns (int) {
        // So we start at a whole token, minus: the keeper fee, the amount of tokens borrowed
        // and the amount of collateral based on the protected tax.
    @>  return int(MAX_PROTECTED_TOKEN_AMOUNT) - int(unlockPrice(_collection, _tokenId));
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

Dust amount can be borrowed for a long time and the positions will still be healthy

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

User creates listing for dust amount and leaves it without unlocking the listing knowing that the position will still be healthy even after long time

### Impact

`CollectionShutdown::execute(..)` can be DOS preventing the shutdown of a collection for a long time

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider implementing an algorithm to prevent users borrowing dust amount for a long period
