# Lack of Access Control on Initialization of InfernalRiftBelow Contract

### Summary

The missing access control in InfernalRiftAbove.sol will cause a critical vulnerability where any user can set the InfernalRiftBelow contract address. This allows a malicious actor to redirect critical bridge operations to a malicious implementation.

### Root Cause

In InfernalRiftAbove.sol:71, the setInfernalRiftBelow function allows any user to set the INFERNAL_RIFT_BELOW contract without any access control restrictions. There is no onlyOwner or permissioned check, meaning anyone can call this function.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/moongate/src/InfernalRiftAbove.sol#L71

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The INFERNAL_RIFT_BELOW value is set to address(0) initially, allowing it to be set by any user.
2. No owner or access control mechanism exists on the setInfernalRiftBelow() function, enabling any user to execute this function.

### External pre-conditions

1. The bridge must be live and in use by legitimate users, relying on the InfernalRiftBelow contract to handle cross-chain token transfers.
2. An attacker must know the uninitialized state of the INFERNAL_RIFT_BELOW value in the contract.

### Attack Path

1. An attacker calls setInfernalRiftBelow(address attackerControlledContract) and sets a malicious contract as the InfernalRiftBelow contract.
2. The attacker-controlled InfernalRiftBelow contract is now the destination for all cross-chain transactions.
3. When users send tokens to be bridged, the attacker can manipulate the tokens sent to the malicious contract, potentially stealing the tokens or redirecting them.

### Impact

The protocol and its users suffer a complete loss of control over cross-chain bridge operations. The attacker gains the ability to hijack token transfers, causing users to lose their bridged tokens. The attacker can manipulate the entire bridging process, gaining control over the assets sent through the bridge.

### PoC

```solidity
contract MaliciousRiftBelow {
    function thresholdCross(Package[] calldata packages, address recipient) external {
        // Malicious logic to steal bridged tokens
        stealTokens();
    }

    function stealTokens() internal {
        // Attack logic
    }
}

// Attacker sets their malicious contract as the rift
InfernalRiftAbove bridge = InfernalRiftAbove(bridgeAddress);
bridge.setInfernalRiftBelow(address(maliciousRiftBelow));
```

### Mitigation

Add an onlyOwner modifier or equivalent access control to the setInfernalRiftBelow() function to restrict its execution to authorized parties. This will prevent unauthorized users from setting the InfernalRiftBelow contract address.

```solidity
function setInfernalRiftBelow(address _infernalRiftBelow) external onlyOwner {
    if (INFERNAL_RIFT_BELOW != address(0)) {
        revert RiftBelowAlreadySet();
    }

    INFERNAL_RIFT_BELOW = _infernalRiftBelow;
    emit InfernalRiftBelowUpdated(_infernalRiftBelow);
}
```
