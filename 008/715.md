# Settings functions frontrun in Moongate

### Summary

_No response_

### Root Cause

The functions:
- [InfernalRiftAbove::setInfernalRiftBelow()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/moongate/src/InfernalRiftAbove.sol#L71)
- [InfernalRiftBelow::initializeERC721Bridgable()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/moongate/src/InfernalRiftBelow.sol#L103)
- [InfernalRiftBelow::initializeERC1155Bridgable()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/moongate/src/InfernalRiftBelow.sol#L119)

are callable by anybody as long as the current addresses are not set to `address(0)`.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Flayer deploys the `InfernalRiftAbove` contract
2. An attacker monitors the chain to know when the `InfernalRiftAbove` has been deployed
3. Attacker calls the functions listed above in order to set wrong address

### Impact

- If an user bridges an ERC721/ERC1155 token while the wrong `INFERNAL_RIFT_BELOW` address is set the bridged tokens will be locked in the `InfernalRiftAbove` contract
- If an user bridges an ERC721/ERC1155 token while the wrong `ERC721_BRIDGABLE_IMPLEMENTATION` address is set a malicious implementations will be deployed on L2, which would allow the attack to steal the bridged ERC721 tokens
- If an user bridges an ERC721/ERC1155 token while the wrong `ERC1155_BRIDGABLE_IMPLEMENTATION` address is set a malicious implementations will be deployed on L2, which would allow the attack to steal the bridged ERC1155 tokens

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Allow the listed functions to only be called by admins and/or set their values in the constructor.
