# INFERNAL_RIFT_BELOW address can be HIghJacked By an Attacker

## Summary

The `InfernalRiftAbove` contract contains a critical vulnerability in its `setInfernalRiftBelow` function, allowing any user to set the `INFERNAL_RIFT_BELOW` address without access control. This can lead to unauthorized control over the contract's core functionality.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `setInfernalRiftBelow` function lacks access control, allowing any external actor to call it and set the `INFERNAL_RIFT_BELOW` address. The only check in place prevents the address from being changed once set, but does not restrict who can initially set it.

```solidity
    function setInfernalRiftBelow(address _infernalRiftBelow) external {
    if (INFERNAL_RIFT_BELOW != address(0)) {
        revert RiftBelowAlreadySet();
    }

    INFERNAL_RIFT_BELOW = _infernalRiftBelow;
    emit InfernalRiftBelowUpdated(_infernalRiftBelow);
}

```


## Impact

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by front-running the contract deployment transaction and setting the `INFERNAL_RIFT_BELOW` address to an address they control. This would give them complete control over the bridge's core functionality, potentially leading to:

1. Theft of bridged assets
2. Manipulation of bridge operations
3. Permanent DoS of the bridge functionality
4. The impact is severe as it compromises the entire bridge system's security and trustworthiness.



## Tool used
Manual Review


## Recommendation

Implement proper access control for the `setInfernalRiftBelow` function. This can be achieved by:

- Adding an owner or admin role to the contract.
- Using a modifier to restrict access to the function.

```solidity
    function setInfernalRiftBelow(address _infernalRiftBelow) external onlyOwner {
        if (INFERNAL_RIFT_BELOW != address(0)) {
            revert RiftBelowAlreadySet();
        }

        INFERNAL_RIFT_BELOW = _infernalRiftBelow;
        emit InfernalRiftBelowUpdated(_infernalRiftBelow);
    }
```
