# `initializeERC721Bridgable` and `initializeERC1155Bridgable` can be called by anyone

### Summary

`setInfernalRiftBelow`, `initializeERC721Bridgable` and `initializeERC1155Bridgable` are all exposed to regular users, i.e. they have no access control and can be configured maliciously  in order to cause loss of funds. 

### Root Cause

The bellow functions lack access control and can be called by users setting them to whatever variables:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/moongate/src/InfernalRiftAbove.sol#L71-L78
```solidity    
    function setInfernalRiftBelow(address _infernalRiftBelow) external {
        if (INFERNAL_RIFT_BELOW != address(0)) {
            revert RiftBelowAlreadySet();
        }

        INFERNAL_RIFT_BELOW = _infernalRiftBelow;
        emit InfernalRiftBelowUpdated(_infernalRiftBelow);
    }
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/moongate/src/InfernalRiftBelow.sol#L103-L126
```solidity
    function initializeERC721Bridgable(address _erc721Bridgable) external {
        if (ERC721_BRIDGABLE_IMPLEMENTATION != address(0)) {
            revert TemplateAlreadySet();
        }

        ERC721_BRIDGABLE_IMPLEMENTATION = _erc721Bridgable;
        emit ERC721BridgableImplementationUpdated(_erc721Bridgable);
    }

    function initializeERC1155Bridgable(address _erc1155Bridgable) external {
        if (ERC1155_BRIDGABLE_IMPLEMENTATION != address(0)) {
            revert TemplateAlreadySet();
        }

        ERC1155_BRIDGABLE_IMPLEMENTATION = _erc1155Bridgable;
        emit ERC1155BridgableImplementationUpdated(_erc1155Bridgable);
    }
```
A likely scenario could occur where users send NFTs, but if the second contract is not properly configured, a malicious user could configure it himself, causing the users to lose funds.

Example:
1. InfernalRiftAbove is deployed and configured
2. InfernalRiftBelow is also deployed, but still not configured
3. Bob sends some NFTs
4. Alice sees that Bob has sent a TX, but also knows that InfernalRiftBelow is not configured
5. She maliciously configures it wrong, making `ERC1155_BRIDGABLE_IMPLEMENTATION` and `ERC721_BRIDGABLE_IMPLEMENTATION` her own custom contracts that don't mint
6. Bob gets his NFTs stuck inside InfernalRiftAbove 

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

None, these functions are hardcoded and exposed to users by default.

### Attack Path

1. The contract has just been deployed on a new L2
2. User sends NFTs to be transferred to a new L2
3. Another users configures the L2 contract with wrong params in order to stuck the NFTs for the first user

### Impact

Contract DOS
Loss of funds

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add these functions to the constructor instead of having custom setters.
