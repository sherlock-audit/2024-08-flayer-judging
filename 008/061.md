# Any user can initialize critical contract parameters, leading to potential exploitation

### Summary

The missing access control in InfernalRiftBelow.sol will cause a critical security risk for the protocol as any user will be able to call the initializeERC721Bridgable() and initializeERC1155Bridgable() functions, allowing them to set malicious contract implementations for bridging operations.

### Root Cause

In InfernalRiftBelow.sol:103 and InfernalRiftBelow.sol:119, there are no access control checks implemented to restrict who can call the initializeERC721Bridgable() and initializeERC1155Bridgable() functions, which allows any user to set these critical implementation addresses.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The ERC721_BRIDGABLE_IMPLEMENTATION and ERC1155_BRIDGABLE_IMPLEMENTATION values are set to address(0) initially, allowing the initialization functions to be called.
2. Any user can call the initializeERC721Bridgable() and initializeERC1155Bridgable() functions to set the respective implementations.

### External pre-conditions

1. The attacker must know the addresses of the protocol and the uninitialized state of the implementation contracts.
2. The bridge must be live and in use by legitimate users, meaning that assets and users rely on these implementations for bridging tokens across chains.

### Attack Path

1. An attacker calls initializeERC721Bridgable(address attackerControlledContract) to set a malicious contract as the ERC721_BRIDGABLE_IMPLEMENTATION.
2. The attacker can now control the ERC721 bridging process and manipulate it to mint, steal, or bypass token transfers.
3. Similarly, the attacker calls initializeERC1155Bridgable(address attackerControlledContract) to set a malicious contract for the ERC1155_BRIDGABLE_IMPLEMENTATION.
4. Once the implementations are set, the attacker can trigger the cross-chain bridge for ERC721 or ERC1155 tokens, exploiting users trying to transfer assets.

### Impact

The protocol suffers a complete loss of control over the token bridging process, as the attacker can now manipulate ERC721 and ERC1155 bridging implementations. Users suffer potential loss of tokens transferred through the bridge due to malicious implementations. The attacker gains the ability to intercept or control token transfers between L2 and L1, leading to significant financial loss for users and the protocol.

### PoC

```solidity
contract MaliciousImplementation {
    function setTokenURIAndMintFromRiftAbove(uint256 tokenId, string calldata uri, address recipient) external {
        // Mint tokens to the attacker's address
        mintTokensToAttacker();
    }
    
    function mintTokensToAttacker() internal {
        // Attack logic to steal tokens
    }
}

// Attacker deploys their malicious implementation and sets it
InfernalRiftBelow bridge = InfernalRiftBelow(bridgeAddress);
bridge.initializeERC721Bridgable(address(maliciousImplementation));
```

### Mitigation

Add an onlyOwner or similar access control mechanism to restrict who can call initializeERC721Bridgable() and initializeERC1155Bridgable(). This ensures only trusted parties can set these critical parameters.

```solidity
function initializeERC721Bridgable(address _erc721Bridgable) external onlyOwner {
    if (ERC721_BRIDGABLE_IMPLEMENTATION != address(0)) {
        revert TemplateAlreadySet();
    }

    ERC721_BRIDGABLE_IMPLEMENTATION = _erc721Bridgable;
    emit ERC721BridgableImplementationUpdated(_erc721Bridgable);
}
```
