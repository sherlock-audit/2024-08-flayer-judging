# Anyone can call `setInfernalRiftBelow()`, DoSing the whole protocol

## Summary
Anyone can call `setInfernalRiftBelow()`, DoSing the whole protocol

## Vulnerability Detail
`setInfernalRiftBelow()` is used to set `INFERNAL_RIFT_BELOW`, which is used for sending NFTs from L1 to L2. But the problem is, it has missing access control.
```solidity
    function setInfernalRiftBelow(address _infernalRiftBelow) external {
        if (INFERNAL_RIFT_BELOW != address(0)) {
            revert RiftBelowAlreadySet();
        }

>       INFERNAL_RIFT_BELOW = _infernalRiftBelow;
        emit InfernalRiftBelowUpdated(_infernalRiftBelow);
    }
```
Malicious user can set any address and the biggest problem is, it can't be changed again as there is a check.

## Impact
Complete protocol will be DoSed
