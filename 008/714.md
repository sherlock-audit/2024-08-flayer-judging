# Unprotected Initialization of ERC721 and ERC1155 Bridge Templates

## Summary

The `InfernalRiftBelow` contract contains two critical vulnerabilities in its `initializeERC721Bridgable` and `initializeERC1155Bridgable` functions. These functions lack access control, allowing any user to set the implementation addresses for ERC721 and ERC1155 bridgeable contracts. This can lead to unauthorized control over the bridge's core functionality and compromise the entire cross-chain NFT bridging mechanism.

## Vulnerability Detail

Both `initializeERC721Bridgable` and `initializeERC1155Bridgable` functions can be called by any external actor to set the respective implementation addresses. The only check in place prevents the addresses from being changed once set, but does not restrict who can initially set them.

```solidity
    function initializeERC721Bridgable(address _erc721Bridgable) external {
    if (ERC721_BRIDGABLE_IMPLEMENTATION != address(0)) {
        revert TemplateAlreadySet();
    }

    ERC721_BRIDGABLE_IMPLEMENTATION = _erc721Bridgable;
    emit ERC721BridgableImplementationUpdated(_erc721Bridgable);
    }

    function initializeERC1155Bridgable(address _erc1155Bridgable) external {
        if (ERC1155_BRIDGABLE_IMPLEMENTATION != address(0)) { 
            revert TemplateAlreadySet();
        }

        ERC1155_BRIDGABLE_IMPLEMENTATION = _erc1155Bridgable;
        emit ERC1155BridgableImplementationUpdated(_erc1155Bridgable);
    }
```


## Impact

An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities by front-running the contract deployment transaction and setting the implementation addresses to contracts they control. This would give them complete control over the bridge's NFT handling mechanisms, potentially leading to:

- Theft of bridged NFTs
- Minting of unauthorized NFTs on the destination chain
- Manipulation of NFT metadata and properties during bridging
- Permanent DoS of the NFT bridging functionality
- The impact is severe as it compromises the entire cross-chain NFT bridging system's security and trustworthiness. Given that the Moongate project is designed to operate on Ethereum mainnet and multiple EVM-compatible L2 chains, as mentioned in the README.md, this vulnerability could have far-reaching consequences across multiple networks.



## Tool used
Manual Review


## Recommendation

Implement proper access control for both `initializeERC721Bridgable` and `initializeERC1155Bridgable` functions. This can be achieved by:

Adding an owner or admin role to the contract or Using a modifier to restrict access to these functions.

Refactored Code

```solidity
    function initializeERC721Bridgable(address _erc721Bridgable) external onlyOwner {
    if (ERC721_BRIDGABLE_IMPLEMENTATION != address(0)) {
        revert TemplateAlreadySet();
    }

    ERC721_BRIDGABLE_IMPLEMENTATION = _erc721Bridgable;
    emit ERC721BridgableImplementationUpdated(_erc721Bridgable);
    }

    function initializeERC1155Bridgable(address _erc1155Bridgable) external onlyOwner {
        if (ERC1155_BRIDGABLE_IMPLEMENTATION != address(0)) { 
            revert TemplateAlreadySet();
        }

        ERC1155_BRIDGABLE_IMPLEMENTATION = _erc1155Bridgable;
        emit ERC1155BridgableImplementationUpdated(_erc1155Bridgable);
    }
```
