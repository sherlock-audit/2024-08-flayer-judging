# No check if floorMultiplier is the same as expected when filling a listing

## Summary
No check if floorMultiplier is the same as expected when filling a listing.

## Vulnerability Detail

When user fills a listing, they only need to specify the collection address and the token ids to be filled.

```solidity
    /**
     * The tokenIds that are being filled against, grouped by the owner of each
     * listing. This grouping is used to optimise gas.
     *
     * @member collection The collection address of the tokens being filled
     * @member tokenIdsOut The tokenIds being filled, grouped by owner
     */
    struct FillListingsParams {
        address collection;
        uint[][] tokenIdsOut;
    }
```

At the same time though, the listing can be modified by the owner by calling [modifyListings()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L303). More  preciously, the owner can update the listing's `duration` and `floorMultiple`.

```solidity
            // Check if we are altering the duration of the listing
           if (params.duration != 0) {
                // Ensure that the requested duration falls within our listing range
                if (params.duration < MIN_LIQUID_DURATION) revert ListingDurationBelowMin(params.duration, MIN_LIQUID_DURATION);
                if (params.duration > MAX_LIQUID_DURATION) revert ListingDurationExceedsMax(params.duration, MAX_LIQUID_DURATION);

                emit ListingExtended(_collection, params.tokenId, listing.duration, params.duration);

                listing.created = uint40(block.timestamp);
@>              listing.duration = params.duration;
            }

            // Check if the floor multiple price has been updated
            if (params.floorMultiple != listing.floorMultiple) {
                // If we are creating a listing, and not performing an instant liquidation (which
                // would be done via `deposit`), then we need to ensure that the `floorMultiple` is
                // greater than 1.
                if (params.floorMultiple <= MIN_FLOOR_MULTIPLE) revert FloorMultipleMustBeAbove100(params.floorMultiple);
                if (params.floorMultiple > MAX_FLOOR_MULTIPLE) revert FloorMultipleExceedsMax(params.floorMultiple, MAX_FLOOR_MULTIPLE);

                emit ListingFloorMultipleUpdated(_collection, params.tokenId, listing.floorMultiple, params.floorMultiple);

@>              listing.floorMultiple = params.floorMultiple;
            }

            // Get the amount of tax required for the newly extended listing
            taxRequired_ += getListingTaxRequired(listing, _collection);
        }
```

Therefore it's possible that the listing's `floorMultiple` is updated to a higher value after the filling transaction is submitted but before it is actually executed. This can happen in different scenarios: 
1. Transaction pending for too long in mempool;
2. Front-run by a malicious user, please note **even if in Base chain mempool is private, front-running is not totally impossible**. Some Base Node operators may allow requests to the txpool_content endpoint, which enabled viewing transactions in their shared mempool prior to them being forwarded to the private Base sequencer transaction pool, see more details [here](https://discord.com/channels/1067165013397213286/1135298514667192460/1143519438163943444). 

As a result, user who fills the listing may suffer a bad trade.

## Impact

The listing can be filled with a higher price than expected.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Allow user to specify a floor multiplier they expect, and revert the transaction if the actual floor multiplier is larger than expected.
