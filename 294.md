# Inconsistent data types

## Summary"
The `_duration` parameter in the `TaxCalculator::calculateTax` function is defined as `uint` (which defaults to `uint256`), while in the `IListings::Listing` struct, the duration is defined as `uint32`. This creates a data type mismatch that can result in inefficiency, particularly in terms of gas consumption and errors in calculations.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `IListings::Listing` struct, duration is defined as a `uint32` (32-bit unsigned integer). However, in the `TaxCalculator::calculateTax` function, `_duration` is passed as a `uint` (which defaults to uint256 or 256-bit unsigned integer). 

## Impact
The impact of this issue is primarily related to gas efficiency. Using a larger data type like `uint256` when only a `uint32` is needed results in higher gas costs for storing and operating on the variable and also incorrect calculations.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure consistency in the data types by changing the `_duration` parameter in the `TaxCalculator::calculateTax` function to `uint32`, matching the `IListings::Listing` struct. 

```solidity
function calculateTax(address _collection, uint _floorMultiple, uint32 _duration) public pure returns (uint taxRequired_) {
    // ...
}
```
