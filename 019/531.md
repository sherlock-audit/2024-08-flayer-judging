# ERC721Bridgable.sol is not ERC-721 compliant

### Summary

As per the readme: *The Bridged721 should be strictly compliant with EIP-721 and EIP-2981*. As per sherlock docs: *If the protocol team provides specific information in the README or CODE COMMENTS, that information stands above all judging rules. In case of contradictions between the README and CODE COMMENTS, the README is the chosen source of truth.* & *The protocol team can use the README (and only the README) to define language that indicates the codebase's restrictions and/or expected functionality. Issues that break these statements, irrespective of whether the impact is low/unknown, will be assigned Medium severity.*
 - The [tokenURI()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/moongate/src/libs/ERC721Bridgable.sol#L95-L97) function is not compliant with the ERC721 standard: *Throws if `_tokenId` is not a valid NFT.*
```solidity
    function tokenURI(uint id) public view override returns (string memory) {
        return uriForToken[id];
    }
```
The function will return empty strings for NFTs that don't exist, instead it should revert. 
- The  [ownerOf()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/moongate/src/libs/ERC721Bridgable.sol#L108-L110) function is not compliant with the ERC721 standard: *NFTs assigned to zero address are considered invalid, and queries about them do throw.*
```solidity
    function ownerOf(uint id) public view override returns (address owner_) {
        owner_ = _ownerOf[id];
    }
```
The function will return address 0 for the owner of an NFT that doesn't exist, instead the function should revert. 

### Root Cause

The [tokenURI()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/moongate/src/libs/ERC721Bridgable.sol#L95-L97) and [ownerOf()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/moongate/src/libs/ERC721Bridgable.sol#L108-L110) functions are not ERC-721 compliant.
