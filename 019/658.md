# The ownerOf function does not revert for invalid token IDs

### Summary

The team requested to verify that the `ERC721Bridgable` is strictly compliant with [EIP-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) and [EIP-2981](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2981). The `ownerOf` function MUST revert if the `id` is invalid (i.e., the token does not exist), however, current implementation does not check that.

### Root Cause

The contract's [ownerOf](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/moongate/src/libs/ERC721Bridgable.sol#L108) function returns `address(0)` instead of reverting when the token does not exist. This behavior is non-compliant with EIP-721.

```solidity
    /// @notice Find the owner of an NFT
    /// @dev NFTs assigned to zero address are considered invalid, and queries
    ///  about them do throw.
    /// @param _tokenId The identifier for an NFT
    /// @return The address of the owner of the NFT
    function ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address);
```

### Mitigation

Use an EIP-721 compliant implementation, such as OpenZeppelin:

```solidity
    function ownerOf(uint256 tokenId) public view virtual returns (address) {
        return _requireOwned(tokenId);
    }
```
