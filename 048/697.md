# ETH Transfer Failure in `TokenEscrow`: Non-Payable Function Attempting ETH Withdrawal

## Summary

The `TokenEscrow` contract attempts to transfer ETH without having a `payable` function, which will cause the transaction to fail when ETH transfer is attempted.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `TokenEscrow.sol:62-67`, the contract attempts to transfer ETH using `SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH()`. However, the function containing this code is not marked as payable, meaning it cannot receive or handle ETH.


```solidity
    if (_token == NATIVE_TOKEN) {
    SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH(msg.sender, _amount);
    } else {
        SafeTransferLib.safeTransfer(_token, msg.sender, _amount);
    }
```


## Impact

This vulnerability will cause all ETH withdrawal attempts to fail, potentially locking ETH in the contract if it has somehow received any. Users will be unable to withdraw their ETH, leading to loss of funds and disruption of the contract's intended functionality.

**Code Snippet**

```solidity
    function withdraw(address _token, uint _amount) public {
        // Ensure that we are withdrawing an amount
        if (_amount == 0) revert CannotWithdrawZeroAmount();

        // Get the amount of token that is stored in escrow
        uint available = balances[msg.sender][_token];
        if (available < _amount) revert InsufficientBalanceAvailable();

        // Reset our user's balance to prevent reentry
        unchecked {
            balances[msg.sender][_token] = available - _amount; 
        }

        // Handle a withdraw of ETH
        if (_token == NATIVE_TOKEN) {
            SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH(msg.sender, _amount); //@audit cant receive eth the function is not payable
        } else {
            SafeTransferLib.safeTransfer(_token, msg.sender, _amount);
        }

        emit Withdrawal(msg.sender, _token, _amount);
    }

```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation

To fix this issue, the function should be marked as payable if it's intended to handle ETH transfers:

```solidity
    function withdraw(address _token, uint256 _amount) public payable {
    // ... existing code ...
    if (_token == NATIVE_TOKEN) {
        SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH(msg.sender, _amount);
    } else {
        SafeTransferLib.safeTransfer(_token, msg.sender, _amount);
    }
    // ... rest of the function ...
}
```
