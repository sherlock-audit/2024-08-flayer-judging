# Using ERC721::_mint() can mint tokens to addresses that do not support ERC721

## Summary
The `ERC721::_mint()` function is used to mint ERC721 tokens but can pose risks if used improperly. Specifically, it allows minting tokens to addresses that might not be able to handle or recognize ERC721 tokens. This can lead to tokens being sent to incompatible addresses. To mitigate this risk, it is recommended to use `_safeMint()` instead of `_mint()`.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `ERC721::_mint()` function directly mints tokens without checking if the recipient address can handle ERC721 tokens. This can result in tokens being sent to addresses that do not support the ERC721 standard, potentially causing the tokens to be lost or becoming inaccessible.

## Impact
**Token Loss:** If tokens are minted to addresses that do not support the ERC721 standard, the tokens may become lost or inaccessible.
**Operational Risks:** Using _mint() without ensuring compatibility can lead to operational issues, as the tokens may not be correctly managed or interacted with.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Replace `_mint()` with `_safeMint()`: Update the contract to use `_safeMint()` instead of `_mint()`. This function provides a safety check to ensure that the recipient address can handle ERC721 tokens, reducing the risk of token loss.
