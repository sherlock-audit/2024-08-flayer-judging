# `Listings::_isLiquidation` flag is not cleaned up; will lead to loss of tax refund for users

### Summary

[Listings::_isLiquidation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L75-L76) is intended to track listings that enter `Listings` contract from `ProtectedListings` contract when a protected listing is liquidated: such a listing is then exempt from the tax refund, as no tax was paid upon the listing creation. 

Unfortunately the flag is not properly cleaned up; in particular:

- [relist](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L625-L672) relists the liquidation listing as another listing
- [reserve](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L690-L759) creates a protected listing from the liquidation listing
- [cancelListings](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L414-L470) doesn't clean the flag, and is executed whenever the listing type is not dutch.

The combination of `relist` call with the subsequent `cancelListings` call is particularly interesting, because:

- As `relist` allows to change the listing type to non-dutch
- The subsequent call of `cancelListings` won't clean the flag, as the listing is now of a non-dutch type
- As a result the flag will be stuck permanently for that token, and will reapply again whenever the token is listed again. 

A similar effect happens via `reserve`. The net effect is that due to the mechanism of `_isLiquidation` flag, the users possessing the listing with that flag set won't get the tax refund they are eligible for.


### Root Cause

Functions [relist](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L625-L672), [reserve](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L690-L759), and [cancelListings](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L414-L470) don't clean up the `_isLiquidation` flag.
 
### Internal pre-conditions

A liquidation listing needs to be relisted or reserved.

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

No attack is necessary

### Impact

Direct loss of funds: if a user happens to possess a listing for which `_isLiquidation` flag was not cleaned up, they won't get the tax refund they are eligible for whenever they cancel or fill the listing.

### PoC

Not required.

### Mitigation

Clean up `_isLiquidation` flag in all functions which delete a listing, or modify the listing type.
