# Insufficient check to ensure that the `poolFee` to be donated to the pool is within the `donateTresholdMin` and `donateThresholdMax` range.

## Summary
After the available fees have been split between the beneficiary and the pool the function doesn't ensure that the amount being sent to the pool is within the specified range, this may lead to `sandwiching reward distribution` of large `poolFee` donations above the `donateThresholnMax` and take advantage of the other users. Also, donations below the `donateTresholdMin` will lead to waste of `gasFee` and loss of funds in the long run as the impact compounds over time.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the contract uniswpImplementation.sol, the function [_distributeFees()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/UniswapImplementation.sol#L316-L345) is an internal function used to distribute fees between the pool and beneficiary and is called during the following functions: `afterSwap`, `beforeAddLiquidity` and `beforeRemoveLiquidity`. The function `donates` poolFee to the `poolManager` and then leaves `beneficiaryFee` in the contract for the beneficiary to claim. The function first checks to see if the `donateAmount` is greater than the minimum threshold before calling `feeSplit()` to split the `donateAmount` between the pool and beneficiary after which the function checks if `poolFee > 0` and if this check validates to true, the poolFee is then sent to the `poolManager` before running the rest of the code. The `issue` here is that the function does not check if the `poolFee` after the `Split` is within the range of  `donateThrsholdMin` and `donateThresholdMax` before calling the `donate` function in `poolManager.sol` which can lead to wasted calls that would distribute less ETH than gas spent, if below range and also lead to targetted distribution to sandwich rewards.
This goes against the intention of the devs as the threshold created is not properly used.

/// Prevents fee distribution to Uniswap V4 pools below a certain threshold:

    /// - Prevents targetted distribution to sandwich rewards
    uint public donateThresholdMin = 0.001 ether;
    uint public donateThresholdMax = 0.1 ether;
```

## Impact
This will lead to wasted calls that don't distribute enough ETH during fee donation below the `donateThresholdMin`, this may seem small but considering the amount of pools that will be created plus the frequency in which the calls are made will create a `compounding` effect that can snowball into a substantial amount. furthermore as stated in the snippet above, it will lead to targeted distribution to `sandwich` rewards.

contract UniswapImplementation is BaseImplementation, BaseHook {

function _distributeFees(PoolKey memory _poolKey) internal {
        // If the pool is not initialized, we prevent this from raising an exception and bricking hooks
        PoolId poolId = _poolKey.toId();
        PoolParams memory poolParams = _poolParams[poolId];

        if (!poolParams.initialized) {
            return;
        }

        // Get the amount of the native token available to donate
        uint donateAmount = _poolFees[poolId].amount0;

        // Ensure that the collection has sufficient fees available
        if (donateAmount < donateThresholdMin) {
            return;
        }

        // Reduce our available fees
        _poolFees[poolId].amount0 = 0;

        // Split the donation amount between beneficiary and LP
        (uint poolFee, uint beneficiaryFee) = feeSplit(donateAmount);

        // Make our donation to the pool, with the beneficiary amount remaining in the
        // contract ready to be claimed.
        if (poolFee > 0) {
            // Determine whether the currency is flipped to determine which is the donation side
            (uint amount0, uint amount1) = poolParams.currencyFlipped ? (uint(0), poolFee) : (poolFee, uint(0));
            BalanceDelta delta = poolManager.donate(_poolKey, amount0, amount1, '');
         //more code...
}
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
A check should be done on `poolFee` after `feeSplit()` has been called to ensure that the poolFee is still within the preferred range set in the base implementation.
And if the `poolFee` is  above `donateThresholdMax` it should be subtracted and saved sending only the maximum value.
