# users can sandwich rewards because of unused donateThresholdMax

## Summary
users can sandwich rewards because of unused donateThresholdMax

## Vulnerability Detail
Some deposit fees will be accured via trading NFT Tokens. These fees will be distributed to Uniswap Pool LP holders. There is one variable `donateThresholdMax` to prevent too much donation. This aims to prevent targetted distribution to sandwich rewards.
For example:
1. There are enough collection token fees in the Uniswap implementation contract.
2. Alice add lots of liquidity in the uniswap v4 pool. 
3. Alice try to do some swap to convert collection token fees to WETH fees.
4. Alice will get some rewards for her Lp and then remove LPs.
```solidity
    uint public donateThresholdMin = 0.001 ether;
    uint public donateThresholdMax = 0.1 ether;
```
```solidity
    function _distributeFees(PoolKey memory _poolKey) internal {
        ...
        // Get the amount of the native token available to donate
        uint donateAmount = _poolFees[poolId].amount0;
        // Ensure that the collection has sufficient fees available
        if (donateAmount < donateThresholdMin) {
            return;
        }
@> missing check donateThresholdMax
```

## Impact
Malicious users can get some rewards via sandwich.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
When we distribute fees to the LPs, make sure the distribution fee cannot exceed `donateThresholdMax` in one block.
