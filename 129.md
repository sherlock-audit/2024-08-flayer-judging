# Incorrect Token Minting Due to Mismatched Recipient Address in Locker::deposit (Line 144)

### Summary

The [deposit() function in Locker.sol ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L144-L166) (Line 144), allows a user to specify a recipient of the ERC20 Collection Token issued by the Flayer Protocol. If a user mistakenly enters or specifies the wrong recipient address to the function, the Collection Token will be minted to an unintended party ([Line 163](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L163)). The result is the user gives away all rights to their NFT.

```solidity
function deposit(address _collection, uint[] calldata _tokenIds, address _recipient) public //@audit final parameter combined with public visibility is the root cause of bug.
        nonReentrant
        whenNotPaused
        collectionExists(_collection)
    {
        uint tokenIdsLength = _tokenIds.length;
        if (tokenIdsLength == 0) revert NoTokenIds();

        // Define our collection token outside the loop
        IERC721 collection = IERC721(_collection);

        // Take the ERC721 tokens from the caller
        for (uint i; i < tokenIdsLength; ++i) {
            // Transfer the collection token from the caller to the locker
            collection.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _tokenIds[i]);
        }

        // Mint the tokens to the recipient
        ICollectionToken token = _collectionToken[_collection];
        token.mint(_recipient, tokenIdsLength * 1 ether * 10 ** token.denomination());

        emit TokenDeposit(_collection, _tokenIds, msg.sender, _recipient);
    }
```

### Root Cause

Two fundamental causes:

**a) DESIGN CHOICE:** The design choice to allow a caller specified token recipient through a public function.
This design choice allows the deposit function to be used elsewhere in the protocol to create deposits. Specifically in two places: [Listings.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L232) and [ProtectedListings.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L179). That said, it also allows the user to use the function and thus creates space for a critical unintended outcome.

**b) PUBLIC VISIBILITY:** deposit() at Locker.sol::144 marked as public. None of the current modifiers prevent the bug.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A user calls locker.createCollection() providing the argument for his NFT collection.
2. The user then approves the address(locker) using setApprovalForAll.
3. User calls locker.deposit() providing a third argument, notably, an address that is not his own.

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

NOTE: It is through user error that this bug can error, rather than direct malicious activity.

1. A user calls locker.createCollection() providing the argument for his NFT collection.
2. The user then approves the address(locker) using setApprovalForAll.
3. User calls locker.deposit() providing a third argument, notably, an address that is not his own.

### Impact

1. Third Party with Collection Token can illegitimately redeem the NFTs that are not truly his.
2. Permanent loss of depositing user's NFTs. Cannot redeem them as he cannot provide burn approval required by [Locker.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L215)
3. Third Party can create a liquid listing for NFTs he shouldn't be in possession of.
4. Third Party can directly sell Collection Token (without redeeming NFTs).

### PoC

Please add the test below to Locker.t.sol
    
```solidity
function test_DepositMintingBug(uint8 _tokens) public {
        // Assume that we don't want to deposit zero tokens.
        vm.assume(_tokens > 0);

        // Approve the ERC721Mock collection in our {Listings}
        locker.createCollection(address(erc721a), 'Test', 'T', 0);

        // Build a tokenIds array from the minted tokens
        uint[] memory tokenIds = new uint[](_tokens);

        // Mint a number of test tokens to our user
        for (uint i; i < _tokens; ++i) {
            erc721a.mint(address(this), i);
            tokenIds[i] = i;
        }

        // Approve the {Listings} contract to manage our ERC721 tokens
        erc721a.setApprovalForAll(address(locker), true);

        // Deposit the token into our {Listings} and confirm that the expected event
        // is emitted.
        // We create a new WRONG address using the private key `1`
        address WrongRecipient = vm.addr(1); 
        
        vm.expectEmit();
        //We modify the expected final argument of event emission to be the mistaken address
        emit Locker.TokenDeposit(address(erc721a), tokenIds, address(this), WrongRecipient); 
        
        //User calls deposit providing the wrong recipient
        //NOTE: the second *PUBLIC* deposit function is called at Locker.sol::144
        locker.deposit(address(erc721a), tokenIds, WrongRecipient);//This is the problematic call

        for (uint i; i < _tokens; ++i) {
            // Confirm that the token is now held by our {Locker}
            assertEq(erc721a.ownerOf(tokenIds[i]), address(locker));
        }

        // Test below passes confirming that the WrongRecipient now holds the equivalent ERC20 Collection Token for an NFT he never deposited!
        assertEq(
            locker.collectionToken(address(erc721a)).balanceOf(WrongRecipient),
            uint(_tokens) * 1 ether,
            'All good, WrongRecipient never received the corresponding ERC20 Collection Token.'
        );
        
        //User never received corresponding ERC20 Collection Token. Test passes.
        assertTrue(
            locker.collectionToken(address(erc721a)).balanceOf(address(this)) !=
            uint(_tokens) * 1 ether,
            'All good, user does have the corresponding ERC20 Collection Token.'
        );
        
        //User balanceOf corresponding ERC20 Collection Token == 0. Test passes.
        assertEq(
            locker.collectionToken(address(erc721a)).balanceOf(address(this)),
            uint(_tokens) * 0 ether,
            'All good, user does have the corresponding ERC20 Collection Token.'
        );
        
    }

```
### Mitigation

A) Disable the feature allowing users to specify token recipient upon NFT deposit.
B) Implement following modifier to continue allowing the function to be called through interfaces by the rest of the protocol. A starting point for a potential modifier to the [deposit() function in Locker.sol ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L144-L166) :

```solidity
modifier specialDeposit {
        // Ensure the only flayer protocol contracts can call this.
        if (msg.sender != [Listings.sol address] || [ProtectedListings.sol address]) revert CannotUseSpecialDeposit();
        _;
    }
```
