# Expensive NFTs Won't Be Listed on Flayer Protocol, as 10x Floor Price for 180 Days Is More Expensive Than a Simple Deposit for 1 CT

## Summary
Currently, anyone who wants to create a listing must pay a **listing tax**, calculated based on the **floorMultiplier** and the **listing duration**. The problem is that it’s **too expensive** to list valuable NFTs on the platform.

## Vulnerability Detail
If a collection has an NFT worth around **9.5x the floor price**, listing it results in significant taxes. The assumption that valuable NFTs would sell within a shorter period is not guaranteed. In fact, it may take **longer** to sell these higher-priced NFTs, as they are more expensive.

Example:
 For an NFT priced at **9.5x the floor price** for **50 days**, the listing tax would be `2.3 CT` (`2361607142857142857`), which amounts to **over 25% in fees**. Even if it sells near the 7-day mark, the seller would still be taxed around `2 CT`.  
 It’s likely that an owner who values their NFT would **cancel the listing** before the 7-day mark, as the NFT could enter a Dutch auction and sell for less. However, **canceling will still result in the fees** being paid.

Other Examples:
- 7x the floor price for 75 days results in a tax of `2.4 CT`.
- 10x the floor price for 179 days is completely **unusable**, as it would incur a tax of `9.2 CT`. At that point, it would be more beneficial to simply **deposit the NFT** and receive the floor `1 CT` in return.

### Calculations PoC

Getting the listing tax via [getListingTaxRequired()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L766-L772) essentially means calling TaxCalculator calculateTax(), so we will use that directly
```solidity
    function getListingTaxRequired(Listing memory _listing, address _collection) public view returns (uint taxRequired_) {
 @>>    taxRequired_ = locker.taxCalculator().calculateTax(_collection, _listing.floorMultiple, _listing.duration);
        taxRequired_ *= 10 ** locker.collectionToken(_collection).denomination();
    }
```    

Add this to `Listings.t.sol` and run with `forge test --match-test test_calculateTax -vvvv`
```solidity
    function test_calculateTax() public {

     //2.4CT for 7.5x floorMultiplier. We will basically get out 5.1CT
     assertEq(taxCalculator.calculateTax(address(erc721a), 750, 75 days), 2417410714285714285);

     //The following tax makes this scenario completely unusable, as we want to get 10CT out, but we already paid 9.2CT in tax:
     assertEq(taxCalculator.calculateTax(address(erc721a), 1000, 179 days), 9205714285714285714);

     // 9.5X Listing for 2.3CT fees, means we can max sell it for 7.2CT
     assertEq(taxCalculator.calculateTax(address(erc721a), 950, 50 days), 2361607142857142857);
    }
```

## Impact
NFTs which are 7-10x floor price/expensive NFTs are not worth listing on the Flayer marketplace, due to the high taxes. Less usage means less fees overall will be send to the UniswapV4 pool.

## Recommendation
Adjust fees to they are appropriate and stimulate users to actually list high price NFTs, as they would bring more fees and value for the Flayer marketplace.
