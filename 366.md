# If the tax is equal to the received tokens, the subtraction will result in tokensReceived being zero.

## Summary
The intention of a tax is to take a portion of the value, leaving the rest for further use (such as for the user or for staking). If the function ends up consuming all tokens as tax (leaving none), then there is no economic incentive for the user to create listings. This is more like a fee that takes everythingâ€”which doesn't align with the concept of taxation
## Vulnerability Detail
If taxRequired equals tokensReceived, after deducting the tax, tokensReceived would be zero.
## Impact
The current check (taxRequired > tokensReceived) prevents over-taxation but could potentially leave tokensReceived as zero.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
If the goal is to ensure that some tokens are left for the user post-taxation, you should modify the logic to prevent tokensReceived from being reduced to zero,
    if (taxRequired >= tokensReceived) revert InsufficientTax(tokensReceived, taxRequired);
