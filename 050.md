# Incorrect Memory Usage Will Prevent Storage Updates for Listings

## Summary
A storage reference for a listing is passed to the `_resolveListingTax` function with a `memory` parameter, which prevents any updates to the storage variable from being persisted. This can result in incorrect tax calculations and listing states, impacting users relying on accurate listing data.

## Vulnerability Detail
In Solidity, passing a storage reference as a `memory` variable means the function operates on a copy of the data, so any changes made within the function will not affect the original storage variable. 

This issue arises in the following line in the `Listings::_fillListing`:

```solidity
(uint fee, uint refund) = _resolveListingTax(_listings[_collection][_tokenId], _collection, false);

```

In this case, `_listings[_collection][_tokenId]` is a storage reference, but it is passed as a `memory` parameter to the `_resolveListingTax` function, which accepts the listing as a `memory` variable:

```solidity
function _resolveListingTax(Listing memory _listing, address _collection, bool _action) private returns (uint fees_, uint refund_) {
```

This causes any modifications to `_listing` within `_resolveListingTax` to only affect the copy and not the original storage, meaning no persistent changes are made to the listing. As a result, crucial listing information such as tax calculations and refunds may not be properly updated or recorded.

## Impact
- **Incorrect Listing Data:** Updates to tax or refunds may not be applied correctly, leading to inaccurate listing information.
- **Logical Inconsistencies:** Contract behavior may deviate from expectations, as the contract's internal state will not reflect changes made during tax calculations.
- **Potential Financial Impact:** Incorrect fees or refunds could cause financial discrepancies, affecting users' balances and leading to potential disputes or exploitation.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To ensure the listing updates persist, modify the `_resolveListingTax` function to accept a `storage` reference for the `_listing` variable:

```solidity
function _resolveListingTax(Listing storage _listing, address _collection, bool _action) private returns (uint fees_, uint refund_) {
```

This change ensures that any updates made to `_listing` will directly modify the storage variable, preventing inconsistencies and ensuring correct tax and refund behavior.
