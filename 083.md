# Unrestricted Withdrawal Frequency Leading to Potential Abuse

## Summary
The `withdraw` function in the `TokenEscrow` contract lacks restrictions on the frequency of withdrawals, allowing users to perform multiple withdrawals in rapid succession. This absence of rate limiting or cooldown mechanisms can lead to potential abuse, such as denial-of-service (DoS) attacks or unauthorized fund depletion.

## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the absence of any checks or mechanisms to limit how frequently a user can call the `withdraw` function. This allows users to repeatedly invoke the function without delay, potentially leading to abuse.
```solidity
49:     function withdraw(address _token, uint _amount) public {
---
51:         if (_amount == 0) revert CannotWithdrawZeroAmount();
52: 
---
54:         uint available = balances[msg.sender][_token];
55:         if (available < _amount) revert InsufficientBalanceAvailable();
56: 
---
58:         unchecked {
59:             balances[msg.sender][_token] = available - _amount;
60:         }
61: 
---
63:         if (_token == NATIVE_TOKEN) {
64:             SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH(msg.sender, _amount);
65:         } else {
66:             SafeTransferLib.safeTransfer(_token, msg.sender, _amount);
67:         }
68: 
---
69:         emit Withdrawal(msg.sender, _token, _amount);
70:     }
```

## Impact
- Repeated withdrawals can overload the system, potentially causing service disruptions for other users.
- Excessive function calls can lead to increased gas consumption and strain on network resources, affecting contract performance.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a rate limiting or cooldown mechanism to restrict how frequently a user can call the withdraw function.
```diff
// Add a mapping to track the last withdrawal time for each user
+ mapping(address => uint256) private lastWithdrawalTime;

// Define a cooldown period (e.g., 1 hour)
+ uint256 private constant COOLDOWN_PERIOD = 1 hours;

function withdraw(address _token, uint _amount) public {
    if (_amount == 0) revert CannotWithdrawZeroAmount();

    // Check if the cooldown period has passed
+   require(block.timestamp >= lastWithdrawalTime[msg.sender] + COOLDOWN_PERIOD, "Withdrawal cooldown period not met");

    uint available = balances[msg.sender][_token];
    if (available < _amount) revert InsufficientBalanceAvailable();

    unchecked {
        balances[msg.sender][_token] = available - _amount;
    }

    if (_token == NATIVE_TOKEN) {
        SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH(msg.sender, _amount);
    } else {
        SafeTransferLib.safeTransfer(_token, msg.sender, _amount);
    }

    // Update the last withdrawal time
+   lastWithdrawalTime[msg.sender] = block.timestamp;

    emit Withdrawal(msg.sender, _token, _amount);
}
```
