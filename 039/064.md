# PUSH0 opcode Is Not Supported on some L2s yet, `InfernalRiftBelow.sol` can't be deployed on them

## Summary
PUSH0 opcode is not supported on L2 chains like Linea 

## Vulnerability Detail
According to contest readme Moongate will be deployed on any number of EVM-compatible L2 chains.
'''
On what chains are the smart contracts going to be deployed?

**Flayer**
_For the purposes of this audit, we will only consider Base as the target network._

**Moongate**
_Ethereum mainnet and any number of EVM-compatible L2 chains._
'''

`InfernalRiftBelow.sol` will be used to Handle the transfer of ERC721 and ERC1155 tokens from L2 -> L1.

Now the issue here is that if the L2 is a chain like Linea where PUSH0 opcode isn't supported the contract is undeployable.

The current code of `InfernalRiftBelow.sol` is compiled with Solidity version 0.8.26, which includes the PUSH0 opcode in the compiled bytecode. According to the [README](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer-AuditorPraise?tab=readme-ov-file#moongate), the protocol will be deployed on the EVM compatible network, which chains like Linea is among.

This presents an issue because Linea does not yet support the PUSH0 opcode, which can lead to unexpected behavior or outright failures when deploying and running the smart contracts.[see here](https://docs.linea.build/developers/quickstart/ethereum-differences#evm-opcodes)


## Impact
Deploying the protocol on Linea with the current Solidity version (0.8.26) may result in unexpected behavior or failure due to the unsupported PUSH0 opcode.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

 use version 0.8.19 for chains like Linea that don't yet support PUSH0
