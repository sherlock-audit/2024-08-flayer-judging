# push0:: opcode is not supported on linea

## Summary
push0:: opcode is not supported on linea

## Vulnerability Detail
The current codebase is compiled with Solidity version 0.8.24, which includes the PUSH0 opcode . According to the `README` :: , the `Moongate` protocol will be deployed on the any L2 EVM compatible network 
[# Moongate  ::> Ethereum mainnet and any number of EVM-compatible L2 chains.]

This presents an issue because Linea does not yet support the PUSH0 opcode, which can lead to unexpected behavior or outright failures when deploying and running the smart contracts.[see here](https://docs.linea.build/developers/quickstart/ethereum-differences#evm-opcodes)

## Impact
Deploying Moongate on Linea with the current Solidity version (0.8.26) may result in unexpected behavior or failure due to the unsupported PUSH0 opcode.

## Recommendation
Use version upto  0.8.19 to compile , for Linea.
