# Protected listing liquidation violates the spec and sends the keeper reward immediately

### Summary

[ProtectedListings::liquidateProtectedListing](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L419-L484) has the following specification in the code comment above:

```solidity
/**
 * Allows a user to liquidate a protected listing that has expired. This will then enter
 * a dutch auction format and the caller will be assigned as the "keeper".
 *
 * When the dutch auction is filled, the keeper will receive the amount of token defined
 * by the `KEEPER_REWARD` variable.
 */
```

The function code violates this spec, and sends the keeper reward of `5%` of the collateral to the caller immediately. As the liquidated position is already underwater (i.e. the user has received or spent as taxes more than the token is worth), this means that `5%` is the immediate loss for the protocol / immediate gain for the caller, which not only violates the spec, but also contradicts common sense, and creates an incentive for self-liquidation.

### Root Cause

Despite the `ProtectedListings::liquidateProtectedListing` spec, and despite the fact that the token [is already underwater](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L430-L432)

```solidity
// Ensure that the protected listing has run out of collateral
int collateral = getProtectedListingHealth(_collection, _tokenId);
if (collateral >= 0) revert ListingStillHasCollateral();
```

the function [sends the keeper reward to the caller immediately](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L438-L439):

```solidity
// Keeper gets 0.05 as a reward for triggering the liquidation
collectionToken.transfer(msg.sender, KEEPER_REWARD * 10 ** denomination);
```

### Internal pre-conditions

The token in question needs to run out of collateral.

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

- Anyone (including bots) can monitor protected listings and submit such a transaction immediately as soon as any listing goes underwater. 
- Specifically for the token owner it is beneficial to self-liquidate, as no matter how deep underwater their token is, they still receive additionally `5%` of its value.

### Impact

Definite loss of funds: the protocol suffers immediate loss of `5%` of the token collateral value. 

### PoC

Not required according to the rules

### Mitigation

Implement `ProtectedListings::liquidateProtectedListing` according to its specification, i.e. send the keeper reward only when the auction is filled.
