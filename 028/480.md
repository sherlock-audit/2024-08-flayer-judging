# `CollectionShutdown:claim()` can be DoS due to use of ownerOf()

## Summary
`CollectionShutdown:claim()` can be DoS due to use of ownerOf()

## Vulnerability Detail
Before users start to claim their ETH, all the NFTs must be liquidated in sudoswap. And to ensure that it calls `collectionLiquidationComplete()`, which checks the ownerOf() the tokenId & if owner is pool then it reverts.
```solidity
function collectionLiquidationComplete(address _collection) public view returns (bool) {
//
        // Check that all token IDs have been bought from the pool
        for (uint i; i < sweeperPoolTokenIdsLength; ++i) {
            // If the pool still owns the NFT, then we have to revert as not all tokens have been sold
>            if (collection.ownerOf(params.sweeperPoolTokenIds[i]) == sweeperPool) {
                return false;
            }
//
    }
```
A Malicious user can buy a NFT & directly send it to the sudoswap pool, which will always return false and transaction will revert.

## Impact
Users will never be able to claim their ETH
