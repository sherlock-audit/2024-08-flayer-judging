# Attacker can prevent users from claiming sale proceeds after collection shutdown

## Summary
A malicious attacker can prevent users from claiming sale proceeds from a collection shutdown due to a flawed ownership check. Moreover, it leaves the sale proceeds irretrievably stuck in the `CollectionShutdown` contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
Once a collection shutdown is executed, the NFTs are [sent into a Sudoswap pool](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L263) to be sold. The sale proceeds are then [claimed by users](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L285-L315) which voted for the shutdown, based on their share:

```solidity
    // Get the number of votes from the claimant and the total supply and determine from that the percentage
    // of the available funds that they are able to claim.
    uint amount = params.availableClaim * claimableVotes / (params.quorumVotes * ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT / SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT);
    (bool sent,) = _claimant.call{value: amount}('');
```

But before users can claim, all NFTs must be sold from the sudoswap pool:

```solidity
    // Ensure that all NFTs have sold from our Sudoswap pool
    if (!collectionLiquidationComplete(_collection)) revert NotAllTokensSold();
```

If we take a look at the check in [more detail](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L445-L467) we can see that it checks if the pool contract is the owner of each NFT:

```solidity
    // Check that all token IDs have been bought from the pool
    for (uint i; i < sweeperPoolTokenIdsLength; ++i) {
        // If the pool still owns the NFT, then we have to revert as not all tokens have been sold
        if (collection.ownerOf(params.sweeperPoolTokenIds[i]) == sweeperPool) {
            return false;
        }
    }
```

The pool uses a price model which decays from 500e18 per NFT to 0 over a few days. The issue is that a malicious attacker can buy up the last NFT (at an affordable price) and then transfer (donate) it to the pool contract (can be bundled tx). Whenever someone tries to claim their share of the proceeds, the `ownerOf` the token ID will still return the pool contract. Since it will now be donated and not deposited in the pool, it will not be able to be re-sold and `collectionLiquidationComplete` check will always return false.

1. Cost of attack is low for close to all collections on Base
2. All sale proceeds stuck in `CollectionShutdown` contract

Due to these impacts of stuck funds and griefing, I believe high severity is warranted.
## Impact
All sale proceeds are stuck so loss of funds for users.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    // Check that all token IDs have been bought from the pool
    for (uint i; i < sweeperPoolTokenIdsLength; ++i) {
        // If the pool still owns the NFT, then we have to revert as not all tokens have been sold
        if (collection.ownerOf(params.sweeperPoolTokenIds[i]) == sweeperPool) {
            return false;
        }
    }
```
## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Re-factor code and find another way to count if all tokens have sold.
