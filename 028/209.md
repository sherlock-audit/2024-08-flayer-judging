# `collectionLiquidationComplete()` can be DoS by directly transferring a collection NFT to the `sweeperPool`

## Summary
`collectionLiquidationComplete()` can be DoS by directly transferring a collection NFT to the `sweeperPool`

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user claim their ETH using claim(), it calls `collectionLiquidationComplete()` to check if all the NFT are liquidated in sudoswap pool or not.
```solidity
function claim(address _collection, address payable _claimant) public nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
...
        // Ensure that all NFTs have sold from our Sudoswap pool
@>      if (!collectionLiquidationComplete(_collection)) revert NotAllTokensSold();
...
    }
```
```solidity
function collectionLiquidationComplete(address _collection) public view returns (bool) {
...
        // Check that all token IDs have been bought from the pool
        for (uint i; i < sweeperPoolTokenIdsLength; ++i) {
            // If the pool still owns the NFT, then we have to revert as not all tokens have been sold
@>         if (collection.ownerOf(params.sweeperPoolTokenIds[i]) == sweeperPool) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
```
To check all NFTs are liquidated or not, it calls `ownerOf()`. Now the problem is a malicious user can buy a NFT of that collection and directly `transfer` it to the `Pool` address. As result, the above check will return `false`, which will revert the `claim()` ie permanently DoS the claim()

## Impact
Claim() can be permanently DoS ie users will not be able to claim their ETH

## Recommendation
Don't use ownerOf() as checking if all NFTs are liquidated or not, instead use any internal mechanism/ counting
