# The last claimant will not be able to claim compensation.

### Summary

In [`start()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L150), quorumVotes are calculated by rounding down. As a result, the claimer who called the claim() function last does not receive a reward.

### Root Cause

When calculating quorumVotes in start(), rounding down occurs.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The last claimant will not be able to claim compensation.

### PoC

The user calls start() to start shutdown vote of collection.
```solidity
    function start(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
        // Confirm that this collection is not prevented from being shutdown
        if (shutdownPrevented[_collection]) revert ShutdownPrevented();

        // Ensure that a shutdown process is not already actioned
        CollectionShutdownParams memory params = _collectionParams[_collection];
        if (params.shutdownVotes != 0) revert ShutdownProcessAlreadyStarted();

        // Get the total number of tokens still in circulation, specifying a maximum number
        // of tokens that can be present in a "dormant" collection.
        params.collectionToken = locker.collectionToken(_collection);
        uint totalSupply = params.collectionToken.totalSupply();
        if (totalSupply > MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS * 10 ** params.collectionToken.denomination()) revert TooManyItems();

        // Set our quorum vote requirement
        params.quorumVotes = uint88(totalSupply * SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT / ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT);

        // Notify that we are processing a shutdown
        emit CollectionShutdownStarted(_collection);

        // Cast our vote from the user
        _collectionParams[_collection] = _vote(_collection, params);
    }
```
At this time quorumVotes is calculated by rounding down.
After calling execute(), user call claim() or voteAndClaim() to claim their reward.
```solidity
    function claim(address _collection, address payable _claimant) public nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        // Ensure our user has tokens to claim
        uint claimableVotes = shutdownVoters[_collection][_claimant];
        if (claimableVotes == 0) revert NoTokensAvailableToClaim();

        // Ensure that we have moved token IDs to the pool
        CollectionShutdownParams memory params = _collectionParams[_collection];
        if (params.sweeperPool == address(0)) revert ShutdownNotExecuted();

        // Ensure that all NFTs have sold from our Sudoswap pool
        if (!collectionLiquidationComplete(_collection)) revert NotAllTokensSold();

        // We can now delete our sweeper pool tokenIds
        if (params.sweeperPoolTokenIds.length != 0) {
            delete _collectionParams[_collection].sweeperPoolTokenIds;
        }

        // Burn the tokens from our supply
        params.collectionToken.burn(claimableVotes);

        // Set our available tokens to claim to zero
        delete shutdownVoters[_collection][_claimant];

        // Get the number of votes from the claimant and the total supply and determine from that the percentage
        // of the available funds that they are able to claim.
        uint amount = params.availableClaim * claimableVotes / (params.quorumVotes * ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT / SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT);
        (bool sent,) = _claimant.call{value: amount}('');
        if (!sent) revert FailedToClaim();

        emit CollectionShutdownClaim(_collection, _claimant, claimableVotes, amount);
    }
```
As you can see, amount is divided by quorumVotes. As a result, amount became bigger so other user has more reward and then last user does not call claim().


### Mitigation

When calculating quorumvotes in start(), use rounding up.
