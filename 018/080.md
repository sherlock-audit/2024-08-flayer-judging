# Admin can sunset a collection without transferring all tokens to Sudoswap pool

### Summary

[CollectionShutdown::execute](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L231) is an onlyOwner function that shuts down a collection, transferring ERC721 assets to a Sudoswap pool for liquidation.

The function accepts an array of tokenIds to transfer out, but does not enforce that the array contains all tokens held by the locker.

This will leave NFTs in the locker contract without an associated collection token, requiring the admin to remove those tokens at some point and decide what to do with them.

### Root Cause

In CollectionShutdown::execute, after the Sudoswap sweeper pool creation, there's a missing check to ensure that the Locker holds no more tokens.

The missing check allows a collection to be shutdown without transferring all of its tokens to the sudoswap pool.

### Internal pre-conditions

A collection is ready to be shut down.

### External pre-conditions

n/a

### Attack Path

Admin shuts down the collection with an incomplete tokenIds array parameter.

### Impact

Tokens will be left over in the locker without any associated owners or ERC20 tokens, leaving it up to the admins to decide what to do.

An incomplete transfer will also decrease the variety of options in the sweeper pool, which can discourage users from buying.

### PoC

In CollectionShutdown.t.sol we add the test:


```solidity

    function test_CanExecuteShutdownWithBadTokenIdsInput() public withDistributedCollection {
    // Make a vote with our test user that holds `1 ether`, which will pass quorum
    collectionShutdown.vote(address(erc721b));

    // Confirm that we can now execute
    assertCanExecute(address(erc721b), true);

    // Mint NFTs into our collection {Locker}
    _mintTokensIntoCollection(erc721b, 3);
    
    uint[] memory tokenIds = new uint[](1);
    tokenIds[0] = 1;

    // Process the execution as the owner
    collectionShutdown.execute(address(erc721b), tokenIds);

    assertEq(erc721b.balanceOf(address(locker)), 2);
    }


```

```bash
[PASS] test_CanExecuteShutdownWithBadTokenIdsInput() (gas: 978248)
Suite result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 2.88s (1.41ms CPU time)

Ran 1 test suite in 2.90s (2.88s CPU time): 1 tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped (1 total tests)
```

### Mitigation

Check that ALL tokens have been transferred, as expected.

```solidity
        // In CollectionShutdown::execute
        // Map our collection to a newly created pair
        address pool = _createSudoswapPool(collection, _tokenIds);

        // Input sanity check:
        if(collection.balanceOf(address(locker)) != 0){
            revert LockerStillHasTokens();
        }
```
