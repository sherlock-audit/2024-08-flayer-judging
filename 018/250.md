# `CollectionShutdown::execute` does not check all tokens are being pulled from the locker when sunsetting a collection, meaning tokens can end up permanently stuck in the locker contract

## Summary
When shutting down a collection, if new tokens are deposited into the protocol between the time between the owner prepares the `_tokenIds` array and the `execute` function being executed, those newly deposited NFTs will be permanently trapped in the `Locker` contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
Consider the following steps:
1. A vote passes to shutdown a collection.
2. The owner of `CollectionShutdown` prepares the array of `_tokenIds` to be pulled from the locker
3. More tokens are deposited into the locker
4. The the `execute` function succeeds, rescuing only the `_tokenIds` passed to the funciton but leaving the newly deposited tokens stuck in the `Locker` contract

## Impact
The newly deposited `_tokenIds` will be permanently locked in the `Locker` contrac.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The `execute` should include a check that `_tokenIds.length == collection.balanceOf(locker)` to ensure that all the tokens for that collection are pulled from the contract before the collection is shutdown.
