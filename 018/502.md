# `CollectionShutdown::execute()` doesn't ensure that all locked NFTs are sold

### Summary

_No response_

### Root Cause

[CollectionShutdown::execute()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L231) doesn't ensure that all tokens of the collection being shutdown are added to the sudoswap pool in order to be sold.

This function takes as input an array of the token IDs to be sold via sudoswap pool. In case an NFT ID that's locked in the protocol is not in this array the NFT will stay locked and not sold.

Even if the function is only callable by admins the admins have no control on the order and the moment transactions are executed and such scenarios should be handled at the moment of execution.

### Attack Path

1. The protocol currently holds NFTs `55` and `56`, admin calls [CollectionShutdown::execute()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L231) by passing as a parameter `[55,56]`. 
2. While the [CollectionShutdown::execute()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L231) transaction is in the mempool a deposit of NFT `60` is done via [Locker::deposit()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L144).
3. The [CollectionShutdown::execute()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L231) transaction goes through and a sudoswap pool selling `55` and `56` is created
4. NFT `60` is locked in the protocol

### Impact

NFTs that should be sold are locked in the procotol, which leads to an indirect loss of funds to collection tokens holders.

### Mitigation

In [CollectionShutdown::execute()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L231) make sure all tokens currently locked in the protocol are added to the sudoswap pool.
