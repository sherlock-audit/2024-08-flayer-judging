# Premature Claim in Collection Shutdown Due to NFT Re-Listing

### Summary

##  Bug Report: Premature Claim in Collection Shutdown Due to NFT Re-Listing

### 1. Bug Title:

Premature Claim Enabled by Relisted NFTs in SudoSwap Liquidation Pool 

### 2. Why this could be triggered?

The current `collectionLiquidationComplete()` function solely verifies if the SudoSwap pool directly owns the NFTs. However, a user can buy an NFT from the SudoSwap liquidation pool and subsequently re-list it. This results in the pool no longer being the owner, misleading the function into wrongly concluding that all NFTs have been sold. Consequently, it prematurely enables claims.

### 3. PoC flow to trigger:

1. **Initiate Collection Shutdown:** Trigger the collection shutdown process, send NFTs to a SudoSwap pool for liquidation. 
2. **Partial Purchase:** A user (User A) buys a subset of the NFTs in the SudoSwap pool.
3. **Re-Listing:** User A lists their recently purchased NFTs, on a platform outside the flayer ecosystem,  at a potentially higher price. 
4. **False Completion Signal:**  The `collectionLiquidationComplete()` function incorrectly returns `true` because the SudoSwap pool no longer owns the relisted NFTs.
5. **Premature Claims:** Token holders, assuming liquidation is complete,  invoke the `claim()` function and withdraw their proportional ETH prematurely, despite remaining unsold NFTs.

### 4. Impact:

* **Incorrect ETH Distribution:** Users could claim a larger ETH share than entitled to if they claim before all NFTs are sold. The  `params.availableClaim` wouldn't accurately reflect the full ETH proceeds from the liquidation if unsold NFTs remain.
* **Potential Losses:** Users who purchased and relisted the NFTs risk potential losses if the relisted NFTs fail to sell at a higher price, leading to an overall reduction in the total ETH collected.
* **Flawed Protocol Logic:**  The bug compromises the intended security and accuracy of the collection shutdown mechanism. It defeats the purpose of equitable ETH distribution amongst token holders based on actual NFT sales proceeds.

### 5.  Code Snippet: 

```solidity
 function collectionLiquidationComplete(address _collection) public view returns (bool) {
     CollectionShutdownParams memory params = _collectionParams[_collection];
     uint sweeperPoolTokenIdsLength = params.sweeperPoolTokenIds.length;

     // If we have no registered tokens, then there is nothing to check
     if (sweeperPoolTokenIdsLength == 0) {
         return true;
     }

     // Store our loop iteration variables
     address sweeperPool = params.sweeperPool;
     IERC721 collection = IERC721(_collection);

     // Check that all token IDs have been bought from the pool
     for (uint i; i < sweeperPoolTokenIdsLength; ++i) {
         // BUG: Only checks for direct SudoSwap pool ownership, 
         //ignores the possibility of NFT re-listing
         if (collection.ownerOf(params.sweeperPoolTokenIds[i]) == sweeperPool) {
             return false;
         }
     }
     return true;
 }
