# The name() and symbol() functions are not compliant with the EIP-20 standard

### Summary

Project team requested to make sure that `CollectionToken` is strictly compliant with EIP-20. The contract allows the owner to change the token's `name` and `symbol` through the `setMetadata` function while they are expected to provide consistent information.

### Root Cause

While [`name`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/CollectionToken.sol#L93) and [`symbol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/CollectionToken.sol#L100) are optional in EIP-20, they are expected to provide consistent information and **MUST NOT** be changed. The [`setMetadata`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/CollectionToken.sol#L83) function allows the owner to update these variables at any time.

### Impact

Lack of requested strict compliance with EIP-20. Changing the token's name and symbol after deployment can lead to confusion among users and incompatibility with wallets that cache these values.
