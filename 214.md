# `ERC721Bridgable` and `ERC1155Bridgable` are not EIP-2981 compliant, and fail to correctly collect or attribute royalties to artists

### Summary

According to the [README](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/README.md#moongate-4):

> The Bridged721 should be strictly  compliant with EIP-721 and EIP-2981
> The Bridged1155 should be strictly  compliant with EIP-1155 and EIP-2981

[EIP-2981](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2981) states the following:

> Marketplaces that support this standard MUST pay royalties no matter where the sale occurred or in what currency, including on-chain sales, over-the-counter (OTC) sales and off-chain sales such as at auction houses. As royalty payments are voluntary, entities that respect this EIP must pay no matter where the sale occurred - a sale conducted outside of the blockchain is still a sale.

The crux of the standard, is that if a contract is EIP-2981 compliant, the royalty _should be paid to the artist who created the NFT no matter where the sale occurred_. For that it first needs to be correctly _reported_ to marketplaces, and _attributed_ to the artist. It's worth noting that as returned by the EIP-2981 function `royaltyInfo`, **both the royalty recipient and the royalty amount are specific to each NFT**:

```solidity
function royaltyInfo(uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _salePrice) external view returns (address receiver, uint256 royaltyAmount);
```

The problem is that both `ERC721Bridgable` and `ERC1155Bridgable` completely violate this crucial property via **both setting a uniform royalty amount across all NFTs, and designating themselves as the royalty recipient**, thus reporting _wrong amounts_, and mixing them together in a _single bucket_. This makes it impossible to either correctly collect the appropriate royalty amounts, or to attribute the collected royalties to artists.

### Root Cause

Both [ERC721Bridgable](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/moongate/src/libs/ERC721Bridgable.sol#L81-L82) and [ERC1155Bridgable](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/moongate/src/libs/ERC1155Bridgable.sol#L63-L64) perform the following in their `initialize` function: 

```solidity
// Set this contract to receive marketplace royalty
_setDefaultRoyalty(address(this), _royaltyBps);
```

As per-NFT royalties are not set, this makes the contract a single recipient of the same `_royaltyBps` across all NFTs, as implemented by OZ's `ERC2981` contract. No matter what happens next, it's impossible to either correctly collect the appropriate royalty amounts at marketplaces, or to correctly attribute the royalties to different artists.

### Impact

Definite loss of funds (NFT creators won't receive the appropriate royalties):

- Marketplaces who sell NFTs on L2s are not able to pay correct amounts of royalties
- Artists who created the NFTs in collections on L1, which are bridged to L2, are not able to track the amounts of royalties they have the right to receive (which effectively deprives them of said royalties)

### Mitigation

Both for `ERC721Bridgable` and `ERC1155Bridgable` have to implement a system which:

- correctly reports per-NFT royalty amounts on L2 via `royaltyInfo`
- correctly collects the appropriate royalty amounts, and tracks the per-NFT recipients of said amounts on L1.

_Notice: this finding concerns only with the absence of the correct tracking and reporting system as per EIP-2981. Royalty distribution system from L2 to L1 is out of scope of this finding._
