# Swaps will revert or unnecessarily cancel due to a mismatched comparison of fTokens with ETH specified amount

### Summary

When the amount specified is the native token (WETH), the check for canceling the swap uses the incorrect token amounts. This causes swaps to either revert or cancel the `beforeSwap` hook.

### Root Cause

Values of different denominations are compared in the `beforeSwap` hook.

ref: [UniswapImplementation::beforeSwap()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/UniswapImplementation.sol#L547-L554)
```solidity
// @audit `-params.amountSpecified` is in WETH (native token) while `tokenOut` is in fToken (collection token)
if (tokenOut <= uint(-params.amountSpecified)) {
    beforeSwapDelta_ = toBeforeSwapDelta(ethIn.toInt128(), -tokenOut.toInt128());
} else {
    // NOTE: cancel the ETH swap
    ethIn = tokenOut = 0;
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Anyone swaps WETH for FToken in a Collection Pool specifying the amount of WETH they sell.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Anyone swaps WETH for FToken in a Collection Pool specifying the amount of WETH they sell.

### Impact

There are two impacts. 
1. Case 1 - `tokenOut > amountSpecified && ethIn < amountSpecified`
  - Cancels the ETH swap even if it should not. Swaps will get canceled almost always for tokens with greater than 18 decimals and cost very little ETH.
2. Case 2 - `tokenOut <= amountSpecified && ethIn > amountSpecified`
  - The swap will revert because there is not enough ETH being sold to handle the hooked swap. This will often get triggered for tokens that cost a lot in ETH.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider modifying the comparison in [`beforeSwap()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/UniswapImplementation.sol#L547) to:

```diff
-if (tokenOut <= uint(-params.amountSpecified)) {
+if (ethIn <= uint(-params.amountSpecified)) {
```
