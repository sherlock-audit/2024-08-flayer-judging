# Incorrect Token Comparison in beforeSwap

### Summary

In the UniswapImplementation contract, an invalid comparison in the `beforeSwap` function leads to users potentially receiving significantly fewer NFT Tokens than expected when swapping Native Tokens (e.g., ETH) for NFT Tokens.

### Root Cause

In `UniswapImplementation.sol`, the `beforeSwap` function incorrectly compares the output NFT Token amount (`tokenOut`) with the input Native Token amount (`params.amountSpecified`) when `amountSpecified < 0`. This comparison should be between amounts of the same native token type.

```solidity
                if (tokenOut <= uint(-params.amountSpecified)) {
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. UniswapImplementation contract has accumulated NFT Tokens as pending pool fees.

### External pre-conditions

1. The contract is processing a swap from Native Token (e.g., ETH) to NFT Token.

### Attack Path

1. **Contract accumulates NFT Tokens as pending pool fees (e.g., 0.01 NFT Tokens)**
2. **User initiates a swap of Native Token (e.g., 1 ETH) for NFT Tokens**
3. **`beforeSwap` function is called with `params.amountSpecified < 0`**
4. **The function incorrectly compares `tokenOut` (0.01 NFT Tokens) with `params.amountSpecified` (1 ETH)**
5. **The condition is satisfied due to the incorrect comparison (0.01 <= 1)**
6. **User receives only the accumulated NFT Tokens (0.01) instead of the expected amount (0.1)**

### Impact

Potential financial losses for users, unintended accumulation of Native Tokens in the UniswapImplementation contract, or unexpected reverts of swap transactions. 

### PoC

Scenario:
* 1 ETH (1e18 wei) is worth ~$2500, 1 NFT Token is worth $25000 (or 0.1 ETH)
* Contract has accumulated 0.01 NFT Tokens in pendingPoolFees
* User wants to buy NFT Tokens with 1 ETH
* `computeSwapStep()` returns `ethIn = 0.1 ETH` and `tokenOut = 0.01 NFT Tokens`
* Incorrect comparison (0.01 NFT Tokens <= 1 ETH) is true
* User spends 1 ETH and gets only 0.01 NFT Tokens instead of the expected 0.1 NFT Tokens
* In this example user loses approximately 90% of the transaction value

### Mitigation

Update the comparison in the `beforeSwap` function to compare the same token types:

```solidity
if (ethIn <= uint(-params.amountSpecified)) {
```
