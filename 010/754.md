# ```UniswapV4Implementation::beforeSwap()``` incorrectly the ```beforeSwapDelta_``` comparing ```tokenOut``` with ```amountSpecified``` while the ```amountSpecified``` is in ```WETH``` terms.

### Summary

The ```UniswapV4Implementation::beforeSwap()``` compares two variables of different terms when it is about to change the ```beforeSwapDelta_``` leading to unexpected behaviour of the hook.

### Root Cause

In ```UniswapV4Implementation::beforeSwap()```, when the user is about to swap ```WETH``` for a ```CollectionToken```, there is two options. He can have specified either the exact ```CollectionToken```s he wants to get out or he can have specified the exact ```WETH```s he want to send in the Pool. The variable ```SwapParams.amountSpecified``` does this job and if it is negative then it represents the ```WETH in``` amount and if it is positive then it represents the ```CT out``` amount. Let's see the ```UniswapV4Implementation::beforeSwap()```:
```solidity
function beforeSwap(address sender, PoolKey calldata key, IPoolManager.SwapParams memory params, bytes calldata hookData) public override onlyByPoolManager returns (bytes4 selector_, BeforeSwapDelta beforeSwapDelta_, uint24 swapFee_) {
             // ...

            // Since we have a positive amountSpecified, we can determine the maximum
            // amount that we can transact from our pool fees. We do this by taking the
            // max value of either the pool fees or the amount specified to swap for.
            if (params.amountSpecified >= 0) {
               // ...
            }
            // As we have a negative amountSpecified, this means that we are spending any amount
            // of token to get a specific amount of undesired token.
@>            else {
                (, ethIn, tokenOut, ) = SwapMath.computeSwapStep({
                    sqrtPriceCurrentX96: sqrtPriceX96,
                    sqrtPriceTargetX96: params.sqrtPriceLimitX96,
                    liquidity: poolManager.getLiquidity(poolId),
                    amountRemaining: int(pendingPoolFees.amount1),
                    feePips: 0
                });

                // If we cannot fulfill the full amount of the internal orderbook, then we want
                // to avoid using any of it, as implementing proper support for exact input swaps
                // is significantly difficult when we want to restrict them by the output token
                // we have available.
@>                if (tokenOut <= uint(-params.amountSpecified)) {
                    // Update our hook delta to reduce the upcoming swap amount to show that we have
                    // already spent some of the ETH and received some of the underlying ERC20.
                    // Specified = exact input (ETH)
                    // Unspecified = token1
                    beforeSwapDelta_ = toBeforeSwapDelta(ethIn.toInt128(), -tokenOut.toInt128());
                } else {
                    ethIn = tokenOut = 0;
                }
            }

            // ...
        }

        // Set our return selector
        selector_ = IHooks.beforeSwap.selector;
    }
```

As we can see in the second ```@>```, in the statement we compare ```tokensOut``` which is in ```CollectionToken``` terms with ```amountSpecified```. However, this is in the case where ```amountSpecified``` is negative so it is referring to ```WETH``` terms and not ```CT``` terms.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Pool to have been initialized and have some liquidity.

### External pre-conditions

1. A user to try to swap ```WETH``` for CT(```collectionToken```) with ```amountSpecified``` negative meaning in ```WETH``` terms.

### Attack Path

1. Liquidity be added through ```Locker::initializeCollection()``` on the Pool.
2. User tries to swap WETH for ETH and specifies the WETH in.

### Impact

The impact of this flaw on ```UniswapV4Implementation::beforeSwap()``` can cause unexpected reverts on some swaps with users not knowing what went wrong. As a result, it will be possible, due to this comparing of ```WETH``` and ```CollectionToken``` which may have different decimals and denomination), lots of swaps from WETH to CT to be reverted or passing while they shouldn't be.

### PoC

No PoC needed.

### Mitigation

To mitigate successfully this vulnerability, consider making this change on ```UniswapV4Implementation::beforeSwap()``` :
```diff
-     if (tokenOut <= uint(-params.amountSpecified)) 
+     if (ethIn <= uint(-params.amountSpecified))
```
