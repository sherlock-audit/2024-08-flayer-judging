# ethIn and tokenOut is not correctly computed in beforeSwap() when the swap is an exactIn

## Summary
`ethIn` and `tokenOut` is not correctly computed in [beforeSwap()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/UniswapImplementation.sol#L490) when the swap is exactIn.

## Vulnerability Detail

Before a swap is made in Uniswap V4 collection pool and the swap is to swap ETH for collection underlying token, protocol will first try to use any pool fee tokens to fill the swap before it hits the Uniswap pool.

[UniswapImplementation.sol#L500-L502](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/UniswapImplementation.sol#L500-L502):
```solidity
        // We want to check if our token0 is the eth equivalent, or if it has swapped to token1
        bool trigger = poolParams.currencyFlipped ? !params.zeroForOne : params.zeroForOne;
        if (trigger && pendingPoolFees.amount1 != 0) {
```

When the swap is an exactIn (`params.amountSpecified` < 0), protocol intends to compute how many collection underlying token can be swapped out by spending the exact amount of ETH. If the full `tokenOut` amount cannot be fulfilled in `beforeSwap()`, protocol avoids to use any of it by resetting `tokenOut` and `ethIn` to 0:

[UniswapImplementation.sol#L535-L555](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/UniswapImplementation.sol#L535-L555):
```solidity
                (, ethIn, tokenOut, ) = SwapMath.computeSwapStep({
                    sqrtPriceCurrentX96: sqrtPriceX96,
                    sqrtPriceTargetX96: params.sqrtPriceLimitX96,
                    liquidity: poolManager.getLiquidity(poolId),
@>                  amountRemaining: int(pendingPoolFees.amount1),
                    feePips: 0
                });

                // If we cannot fulfill the full amount of the internal orderbook, then we want
                // to avoid using any of it, as implementing proper support for exact input swaps
                // is significantly difficult when we want to restrict them by the output token
                // we have available.
@>              if (tokenOut <= uint(-params.amountSpecified)) {
                    // Update our hook delta to reduce the upcoming swap amount to show that we have
                    // already spent some of the ETH and received some of the underlying ERC20.
                    // Specified = exact input (ETH)
                    // Unspecified = token1
                    beforeSwapDelta_ = toBeforeSwapDelta(ethIn.toInt128(), -tokenOut.toInt128());
                } else {
                    ethIn = tokenOut = 0;
                }
```

There are essentially 2 errors in the code:

1. When computes `tokenOut` and `ethIn`, [SwapMath.computeSwapStep()](https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-core/blob/18b223cab19dc778d9d287a82d29fee3e99162b0/src/libraries/SwapMath.sol#L51-L57) is called, but the `amountRemaining` argument is assigned with `int(pendingPoolFees.amount1)`. 
This is wrong because`pendingPoolFees.amount1` is the collection underlying token amount and is non-negative.
The correct value that should be used is `params.amountSpecified`, by doing that we are actually computing the `tokenOut` by using the exactly amount of `ethIn`.

2. When determines if we can fullfill the full amount of `tokenOut`, protocol check it against `uint(-params.amountSpecified)`. 
This is wrong because `params.amountSpecified` is ETH amount and it does not make sense to compare the amount of 2 different tokens. 
The correct approach is to check `tokenOut` against `pendingPoolFees.amount1`, which is the amount of collection underlying token.

## Impact

Incorrect amount of tokens are sent out / pulled in, the trader or the hook may suffer a loss.
