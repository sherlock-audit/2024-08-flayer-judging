# Protocol will still use fee to cover exact-in swaps even when fee is not enough to fill

## Summary
Due to the logic error, beforeSwap() will still use fee to cover the swap ( for exact in swap) even when it is not enough to do so.

## Vulnerability Detail
As commented in the code, in swaps using exact in option, using fee to cover the swaps should be avoided
```solidity
               // If we cannot fulfill the full amount of the internal orderbook, then we want
                // to avoid using any of it, as implementing proper support for exact input swaps
                // is significantly difficult when we want to restrict them by the output token
                // we have available.
```
However, due to the logic error  in the current implementation, **fee will  be used only when it is not enough to cover the swap (and vice versa)**, which is opposite with the intent stated in the comment.

```solidity
            >>>    if (tokenOut <= uint(-params.amountSpecified)) { //@audit - opposite with the comments
                    // Update our hook delta to reduce the upcoming swap amount to show that we have
                    // already spent some of the ETH and received some of the underlying ERC20.
                    // Specified = exact input (ETH)
                    // Unspecified = token1
                    beforeSwapDelta_ = toBeforeSwapDelta(ethIn.toInt128(), -tokenOut.toInt128());
                } else {
                    ethIn = tokenOut = 0;
                }
```
## Impact
Incorrect fee swap management (selling/buying token) might affect the price of the collection token negatively.

## Recommendation
Consider this change:
```solidity
  >>>    if (tokenOut >= uint(-params.amountSpecified)) {
                    // Update our hook delta to reduce the upcoming swap amount to show that we have
                    // already spent some of the ETH and received some of the underlying ERC20.
                    // Specified = exact input (ETH)
                    // Unspecified = token1
                    beforeSwapDelta_ = toBeforeSwapDelta(ethIn.toInt128(), -tokenOut.toInt128());
                } else {
                    ethIn = tokenOut = 0;
                }
```
