# Reverting on Zero Address Transfers makes The CollectionToken not compliant with EIP-20

### Summary
The README clearly states the following

>The CollectionToken should be strictly compliant with EIP-20

The OpenZeppelin ERC-20 implementation (which the collection token inherits) will revert when a transfer to the zero address (address(0)) is attempted. 

According to the ERC-20 standard, the transfer() and transferFrom() functions must transfer the specified amount to the _to address and fire the Transfer event. Reverting when the _to address is zero conflicts with this requirement, as the tokens are not transferred as mandated.

### Root Cause

The OpenZeppelin implementation of _transfer() and the CollectionTokenâ€™s mint() method contain logic to revert when the to address is zero, preventing the transfer from being completed. This behavior does not align with the specification, which requires that tokens be transferred to the recipient address.
