# There is no way to replay failed messages in the `InfernalRiftAbove` and `InfernalRiftBelow` contract

### Summary

In the `InfernalRiftAbove` and `InfernalRiftBelow` contracts, sent messages could fail for any reason, but there is no way to retry/retrieve failed messages leading to loss of funds.

### Root Cause

users can [send ERC721](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/moongate/src/InfernalRiftAbove.sol#L83) and [ERC1155]() tokens cross chain between L1 and L2 using the `InfernalRiftAbove` and `InfernalRiftBelow` contracts. However, transactions can fail and there is no way to retrieve or retry them because the contracts do not expose functions for these purposes. Leading to funds getting stuck in the contracts.

### Internal pre-conditions

Protocol does not make room for retrying or retrieving failed transactions

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Possible loss of NFT for users who want to transfer asset between L1 and L2

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement functions to enable retrying failed messages.
