# The liquidity injection function does not take into account the impact of currency flipping, leading to potential funding errors

## Summary
The liquidity injection function does not take into account the impact of currency flipping, leading to potential funding errors
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `initializeCollection` function of `UniswapImplementation.sol`, the parameters `amount0` and `amount1` of `CallbackData` take into account the case of currencyFlipped, but `liquidityTokens` does not take into account the case of currencyFlipped. The default is that `liquidityTokens` is `_amount1`. In fact, this is only one case, and there is another case that has not been judged.

### First case:
• When `currencyFlipped` == `true`:
• `amount0` actually represents the amount of the underlying token.
• `amount1` represents the amount of ETH equivalent tokens.
• In this case, liquidityTokens should point to `_amount0`, because `amount0` now represents the amount of the underlying token (originally the role of `amount1`).
### Second case:
• When `currencyFlipped` == `false`:
• `amount0` is the ETH equivalent token.
• `amount1` is the underlying token.
• In this case, liquidityTokens correctly points to `_amount1` because it represents the amount of the underlying token.
## Impact
Due to improper handling of token flipping logic, liquidityTokens may point to the wrong number of tokens, resulting in biased liquidity calculations.
## Code Snippet

```solidity
        poolManager.unlock(
            abi.encode(CallbackData({
                poolKey: poolKey,
                liquidityDelta: LiquidityAmounts.getLiquidityForAmounts({
                    sqrtPriceX96: _sqrtPriceX96,
                    sqrtPriceAX96: TICK_SQRT_PRICEAX96,
                    sqrtPriceBX96: TICK_SQRT_PRICEBX96,
                    amount0: poolParams.currencyFlipped ? _amount1 : _amount0,
                    amount1: poolParams.currencyFlipped ? _amount0 : _amount1
                }),
                liquidityTokens: _amount1,
                liquidityTokenSlippage: _amount1Slippage
            })
        ));
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
If `currencyFlipped` is `true`, it means that the token roles have been flipped, and you will now treat B as the underlying token, so the logic originally based on A should be replaced by the logic based on B.

So in the code, if `currencyFlipped` == `true`, you should actually use _amount0 to represent liquidityTokens, because after the flip, the amount of the underlying token changes from amount1 to amount0.
```solidity
        poolManager.unlock(
            abi.encode(CallbackData({
                poolKey: poolKey,
                liquidityDelta: LiquidityAmounts.getLiquidityForAmounts({
                    sqrtPriceX96: _sqrtPriceX96,
                    sqrtPriceAX96: TICK_SQRT_PRICEAX96,
                    sqrtPriceBX96: TICK_SQRT_PRICEBX96,
                    amount0: poolParams.currencyFlipped ? _amount1 : _amount0,
                    amount1: poolParams.currencyFlipped ? _amount0 : _amount1
                }),
                liquidityTokens: poolParams.currencyFlipped ? _amount0 : _amount1,
                liquidityTokenSlippage: _amount1Slippage
            })
        ));
```
