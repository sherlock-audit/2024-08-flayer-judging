# Lack of CryptoPunks Support on ƒlayer Limits Market Potential and Integration with ERC721 Protocol

## Summary
**CryptoPunks** was one of the first non-fungible token projects and has since paved the way for other successful **NFT** collections such as CryptoKitties, Bored Ape Yacht Club, and **CrypToadz**.  
ƒlayer, which enables Liquid Listings, cannot support **CryptoPunks**, which reduces their overall market potential.
## Vulnerability Detail
CryptoPunks collections that do not support the `transferFrom()` function can present risks that users with CryptoPunks cannot use this protocol.

Here is an example [implementation](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-nftx/blob/main/nftx-protocol-v2/contracts/solidity/NFTXStakingZap.sol#L417-L424) of what it might look like to integrate cryptopunks into the Foundation protocol.
## Impact
Cryptopunks are at the core of the `NFT` ecosystem. As one of the first NFTs, it embodies the culture of NFT marketplaces. By not supporting the trading of `cryptopunks`, Foundation is at a severe disadvantage when compared to other marketplaces. Cryptopunks have their internal marketplace which allows users to trade their `NFTs` to other users. As such, cryptopunks do not adhere to the `ERC721` standard, it will always fail when the protocol attempts to trade them.

## Recommendation
Consider designing a wrapper contract for `cryptopunks` to facilitate standard ERC721 transfers. The logic should be abstracted away from the user such that their user experience is not impacted.
