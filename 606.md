# Collections with very cheap and very expensive NFTs won't be fully supported by the Flayer marketplace

## Summary
In many NFT collections, there are extraordinary NFTs that are sold for significantly more than the floor price. In this case, the Flayer protocol won't be able to support highly valued NFTs.

## Vulnerability Detail
The **floor price** typically refers to the minimum amount that an NFT from a collection is listed for, but this value can be arbitrary. In the Flayer marketplace, the floor price should represent the **actual minimum value** of an NFT from a Collection, as it would naturally balance itself based on "what most people agree the floor price is."

There are many NFT collections with NFTs that have sold for **far more than 10x** the floor price. For example, some NFTs can be priced at `15x`, `20x`, `30x`, `100x`, or even more compared to the floor price.  
Collections like [Bored Ape Yacht Club](https://opensea.io/collection/boredapeyachtclub?search[sortAscending]=false) and [CryptoPunks](https://opensea.io/collection/cryptopunks) provide multiple examples of this.

The current [MAX_FLOOR_MULTIPLIER](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L79) in the Flayer marketplace is hardcoded to `10`, thus the protocol cannot support these **valuable NFTs**.

**Airdrop Cases**: It's possible that someone could send airdrops for marketing purposes. Usually, they will distribute less valuable NFTs, as this is done purely for marketing. Itâ€™s not uncommon to see their actual NFTs priced much higher than 10x the floor ones.

## Impact
The 10x floor multiplier limit prevents the listing of valuable NFTs, which can limit the usability of the platform for those trading high-priced assets. Less activity would mean fewer fees distributed.

Usually, high-value NFTs get most of the attention, so missing out on those will negatively impact the usage of the marketplace.

## Tool Used
**Manual Review**

## Recommendation
Consider **increasing the 10x floor multiplier limit**, or allow the **Admin** to adjust the multiplier in cases where it's needed to support high-value NFTs.
