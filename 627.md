# Incorrectly set `mint` variable in `InfernalRiftBelow::_thresholdCross1155` causes a revert, which prevents tokens from being transfered and minted

## Summary
The `mint` variable gets set to either 0 or a negative number, because `transfer` is always going to be greater than or equal to the `amount`.

## Vulnerability Detail 
When `mint` gets set to a negative value, a revert occurs because a unit cannot be negative, and that disrupts the flow of the function.

## Impact
The `l2Collection1155` can neither transfer nor mint any tokens after `mint` reverts.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
This issue can be mitigated by setting `mint` to the result of `transfer - amount`.
