# `Paused NFT` collections will cause users to lose taxRefunds

## Summary
`Paused NFT` collections will cause users to lose taxRefunds

## Vulnerability Detail
Many NFTs like [pudgyPenguins](https://etherscan.io/token/0xbd3531da5cf5857e7cfaa92426877b022e612cf8#readContract)/ [lilPudgys](https://etherscan.io/token/0x524cab2ec69124574082676e6f654a18df49a048#readContract) have a paused functionality. If paused it prevents any transfer of the NFTs. 

Suppose a user listed his tokenId paying listingTax, now he wanted to cancel his listings but cancelListing() reverted due to pause.
```solidity
 function _resolveListingTax(Listing memory _listing, address _collection, bool _action) private returns (uint fees_, uint refund_) {
//
        // Get the amount of tax to be refunded. If the listing has already ended
        // then no refund will be offered.
        if (block.timestamp < _listing.created + _listing.duration) {
>            refund_ = (_listing.duration - (block.timestamp - _listing.created)) * taxPaid / _listing.duration;
        }
//
    }
```

 And as we seen above taxRefund is calculated based on time tokenId is listed for & if duration is passed then no refund.

As result, refund amount of user will keep decreasing till 0(zero)

## Impact
User will lose tax refund if collection is paused

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Detached the NFT from cancelListing() ie make a mapping that stores the time when a user called cancelListing()
