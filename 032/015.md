# Paused ERC721 collection will revert cancelListings(), making loss of listingTax for users

## Summary
Paused ERC721 collection will revert `cancelListings()`, making loss of `listingTax` for users

## Vulnerability Detail
Many ERC721 tokens, including well-known projects such as `PudgyPenguins/ LilPudgys`(all supports ERC721 interfaceId ie `0x80ac58cd`), have a pause functionality inside the contract. This pause functionality will cause the `cancelListings()` call to always revert.

It can be observed PudgyPenguins has paused functionality: https://etherscan.io/token/0xbd3531da5cf5857e7cfaa92426877b022e612cf8#readContract
It can be observed LilPudgys has paused functionality: https://etherscan.io/token/0x524cab2ec69124574082676e6f654a18df49a048#readContract

When cancelListings() is called, it withdraws the `tokenId` from Locker contract and `transfers` it to msg.sender along with any `unused` amount of tax(collected while listing).
```solidity
    function cancelListings(address _collection, uint[] memory _tokenIds, bool _payTaxWithEscrow) public lockerNotPaused {
...
             // Find the amount of prepaid tax from current timestamp to prepaid timestamp
            // and refund unused gas to the user.
@>          (uint _fees, uint _refund) = _resolveListingTax(listing, _collection, false);
            emit ListingFeeCaptured(_collection, _tokenId, _fees);

...
            // Transfer the listing ERC721 back to the user
@>          locker.withdrawToken(_collection, _tokenId, msg.sender);
        }
...
    }
```
```solidity
    function withdrawToken(address _collection, uint _tokenId, address _recipient) public {
        if (!lockerManager.isManager(msg.sender)) revert CallerIsNotManager();
@>      IERC721(_collection).transferFrom(address(this), _recipient, _tokenId);
    }
```

Now the problem is, `taxRefund` amount is dependent on how much time tokenId was listed for & if listing duration is ended then no taxRefund
```solidity
function _resolveListingTax(Listing memory _listing, address _collection, bool _action) private returns (uint fees_, uint refund_) {
...
        // Get the amount of tax to be refunded. If the listing has already ended
        // then no refund will be offered.
        if (block.timestamp < _listing.created + _listing.duration) {
@>          refund_ = (_listing.duration - (block.timestamp - _listing.created)) * taxPaid / _listing.duration;
        }
...
    }
```
Consider a scenario where user `listed` his tokenId paying `listingTax`, now he wanted to cancel his listings but `cancelListing()` reverted due to pause. And as we seen above `taxRefund` is calculated based on `time` tokenId is listed for & if duration is passed then no refund. 

As result, refund amount of user will keep `decreasing` till 0(zero)

## Impact
User will loss all his tax refund amount

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use a mapping that stores the timestamp when user cancelListing() & based on that timestamp, calculate tax refund amount ie decouple the NFT from cancelListing()
