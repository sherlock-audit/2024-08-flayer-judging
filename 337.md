# Second Preimage Attack in `AirdropRecipient::claimAirdrop` function allows attacker to claim airdrops of other users

### Summary

The `AirdropRecipient::claimAirdrop` function is vulnerable to a "Second Preimage Attack" due to insufficient validation of leaf nodes in the Merkle tree. This type of attack occurs when an attacker is able to pass an `intermediate node` —which is 64 bytes long and composed of two 32-byte child hashes— as a `leaf node`. This shortens the Merkle tree and allows the attacker to bypass validation checks, ultimately gaining unauthorized access to airdrops.

A Merkle tree's, `leaf nodes` should be constructed from raw data, such as the `IAirdropRecipient::MerkleClaim` struct `address recipient, address target, uint tokenId, uint amount`, and hashed with `keccak256` to produce a 32-byte long hash of the data. However, if `intermediary nodes` are accepted as valid `leaf nodes`, an attacker can manipulate the Merkle tree by submitting these `intermediary nodes` as input into the `claimAirdrop` function. This allows the attacker to reconstruct a valid Merkle root and claim airdrops intended for other users.

More context on this attack vector can be found in this [RareSkills article](https://www.rareskills.io/post/merkle-tree-second-preimage-attack).

This vulnerability can be avoided if the contract enforces that only 32-byte leaf nodes, derived from hashing raw data —e.g. `keccak256(abi.encode(MerkleClaim))`— are accepted into the function OR if the contract must handle 64-byte `_nodes`, the recommended mitigation is to apply a double-hashing mechanism to the `leaf nodes` input data before verifying them against the Merkle root. This ensures that `intermediary nodes` cannot be used to shorten the Merkle tree and bypass validation.

### Root Cause

The vulnerability stems from the way that the `AirdropRecipient::claimAirdrop` function verifies the Merkle root, proof, and leaves. The current implementation does not ensure that the `leaf nodes` passed during the claim process are raw data hashes (32 bytes). As a result, an attacker can pass `intermediary nodes` (64 bytes) as leaf nodes into the `claimAirdrop` function. This allows the attacker to bypass the tree's hierarchical structure, reaching the correct Merkle root without properly traversing the entire tree.

By accepting `intermediary nodes` as `leaf nodes`, the contract allows an attacker to submit a shortened version of the Merkle tree that still hashes to the expected root. The lack of distinction between intermediary and leaf nodes creates an opening for this attack. The contract fails to properly verify that `leaf nodes` are constructed from the raw data, and does not hash the `_nodes` data twice before comparison, as recommended by OpenZeppelin for preventing "Second Preimage Attacks".

You can see [here](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/merkle-tree?tab=readme-ov-file#validating-a-proof-in-solidity) how OpenZeppelin does a double `keccak256` hashing of the input data before verifying the leaf.

```solidity
    function verify(...) public {
        //..
        bytes32 leaf = keccak256(bytes.concat(keccak256(abi.encode(addr, amount))));
        require(MerkleProof.verify(proof, root, leaf), "Invalid proof");
        //..
        //..
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The `Locker` contract receives an airdrop and decides to distribute it to listing owners.
- There is no explicit check to prevent passing `intermediary nodes` as `leaf nodes` into the `claimAirdrop` function.
- The contract hashes the input `MerkleClaim calldata _node` only once instead of twice.
- Lack of checks for `msg.sender`. The contract doesn't check if `msg.sender` is the intended airdrop recipient, `_node.recipient`.

### External Pre-conditions

- An attacker reconstructs `intermediary nodes` within the Merkle tree (e.g. the hash of two lower-level leaves).

### Attack Path

***1. Constructing the tree:*** Assuming the Merkle tree is built using raw data `recipient, target, tokenId, and amount` as the input to the leaves, an attacker can reconstruct the tree by concatenating and hashing adjacent leaf nodes and intermediary nodes.

***2. Submitting an intermediary node as a leaf:*** By calling the `AirdropRecipient::claimAirdrop` function with an `intermediary node` as input instead of `leaf node` the contract will reconstruct the expected Merkle root, and the attacker bypassed the tree's hierarchical structure, reaching the correct Merkle root without properly traversing the entire tree.

***3. Claiming airdrops with shorter Merkle trees:*** By exploiting the mismatch between the leaf node and the intermediary node they provided, the attacker can claim the airdrops on behalf of other users or for themselves.

### Impact

- If the `recipient` address in the `IAirdropRecipient ::MerkleClaim` struct is set to `msg.sender`, the attacker submitting the proof can straight up steal the airdrops of other users.

- If the `recipient` is a smart contract that has custom `receive` or `fallback` functions for dealing with `ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155 or native` tokens, these functions can be triggered and lead to unexpected behavior.

- Depending on the type of airdrop different transfer methods are used. In the case of `ERC721` tokens, the contract uses `transfeFrom` instead of `safeTransferFrom`. If the recipient is a smart contract that doesn't implement the `IERC721Receiver` interface and is not meant to handle `ERC721` tokens, these NFTs may be stuck in the contract.

- In a real-world example, depending on the actual distribution mechanism of an airdrop, allowing another user to claim the airdrop on behalf of others can lead to unexpected outcomes such as stolen assets, loss of funds, or other damage to the airdrop distribution process.

- Allowing a user can claim the airdrops on behalf of other users without needing prior approval can lead to ***confusion, panic, and reputational damage to the protocol***.  Imagine that the airdrop is a big one such as the `OP` token, or `LayerZero` token, or OpenSea's `Gemesis` collection which had 100.000+ recipients. If user `A` claims the airdrops on behalf of `20.000` other users, all the `20.000` intended `recipients` will have failed transactions when they attempt to claim because the airdrop was already claimed, but they are unaware of it. Some of these users will hop into Discord and social media to complain, blame, and accuse the protocol of being scammed because they were not able to claim their airdrops which can cause a lot of reputational damage to the protocol. Furthermore, each case will need to be solved on a 1 by 1 basis so it will be a very time intensive and resource heavy process for the protocol team to deal with such a case.

### PoC

- The test cases provided in the codebase contain a Merkle tree that is constructed based on hashes of the raw data from the `MerkleClaim` structs, and not from the raw data itself. We can see this in the `AirdropRecipient.t.sol` file by looking at the `_setupMerkle` function.

```javascript
    function _setupMerkle() public {
        // ERC20 setup
        // 0xc3338f97d3e72c881e2aabefc2ac0161bf5927649ae9333027e85565c82fbbba -- merkle root

        //@audit hashed raw data for address(1)
        // emit log_bytes32(keccak256(abi.encode(IAirdropRecipient.MerkleClaim(address(1), address(erc20), 0, 1 ether)))); 
        // 0x9e6a01866327b729a94cd8c6fc0ae0d817f810bb08c0d14e8020d3093e1b6138

        //@audit hashed raw data for address(2)
        // emit log_bytes32(keccak256(abi.encode(IAirdropRecipient.MerkleClaim(address(2), address(erc20), 0, 3 ether)))); 
        // 0xb8ed74468db61e063ea2bf844378feb9811fab1b3e2e9ce598339f9ca02be17f

        //@audit hashed raw data for address(4)
        // emit log_bytes32(keccak256(abi.encode(IAirdropRecipient.MerkleClaim(address(4), address(erc20), 0, 5 ether)))); 
        // 0xbd072f74f9ec98e1d63241cb61acfe2c303694af91970a1031766c142e702389
```

If we take the 3 outputs of the hashes and put them into the website indicated in the docs https://lab.miguelmota.com/merkletreejs/example/ and we reconstruct the Merkle tree, we'll get the same Merkle root as the one above `0xc3338f97d3e72c881e2aabefc2ac0161bf5927649ae9333027e85565c82fbbba `.

To do this you need to go to the link above, input the 3 hashes in the same order as in the print screen below, toggle `keccak256` on, and untick everything else.
The Merkle tree was created based on the hashes of the raw data, this is why we need to untick everything else, as shown in the print screen below. If you toggle anything else on, you'll get a different Merkle root and the tests won't work.

You can see our Merkle tree above which was constructed based on the hashed raw data from the sponsor's test files.

Put this test into the `AirdropRecipient.t.sol` file and run it.

```solidity
    function test_claimWithIntermediaryNodeInput() public {
        _setupMerkle();

        bytes32[] memory newProof = new bytes32[](1);
        newProof[0] = 0x4f77c2f624aaebc44e3f5fdc4fbc6000b865a9832d87a25e73758036bf0724fa;

        locker.claimAirdrop({
            _merkle: 0xc3338f97d3e72c881e2aabefc2ac0161bf5927649ae9333027e85565c82fbbba,
            _claimType: Enums.ClaimType.ERC20,
            _node: IAirdropRecipient.MerkleClaim({
                recipient: address(4),
                target: address(erc20),
                tokenId: 0,
                amount: 5 ether
            }),
            _merkleProof: newProof
        });

        // Confirm that our user holds the expected tokens
        assertEq(erc20.balanceOf(address(4)), 5 ether);
    }
```

In the PoC, the `newProof` variable contains the `intermediary node`  hash marked with red in the print screen above, which allows us to call the `claimAirdrop` function. This demonstrates that the contract does not explicitly prevent the submission of intermediary nodes as leaf nodes and it's not resistant to the "Second Preimage Attack" vulnerability as described in the RareSkills article.

While the PoC appears to succeed in claiming the tokens for `address(4)`, the actual real-world implementation of an airdrop mechanism may be different than the one that we have in the test files. Allowing intermediary nodes to be passed in as leaf nodes is not a secure way of verifying Merkle proofs.

### Mitigation

***1. [Double hash leaf nodes:](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/AirdropRecipient.sol#L121)*** As recommended by OpenZeppelin, apply a double `keccak256` hashing to the input data before verifying it against the Merkle root. This is the equivalent of using a different hash function for the leaf nodes and this approach ensures that even if a user tries to submit `intermediary nodes` as leaves, they will not match the expected root. If you change this line of code as shown below, the test that I shared previously will fail, meaning that the function will not accept intermediary nodes as leaf nodes anymore.

```diff
    function claimAirdrop(...) public {
//..
-       bytes32 nodeHash = keccak256(abi.encode(_node));
+       bytes32 nodeHash = keccak256(bytes.concat(keccak256(abi.encode(_node))));
//..
    }
```

***2. Consider adding ownership check:*** To further restrict this function, an extra check can be added to enforce that only the intended airdrop `recipient` can claim a particular airdrop. This will block users from claiming from a different address though. If a user has multiple addresses, they'll need to claim from the one that was set as `_node.recipient` if they want the airdrop.

```diff
    function claimAirdrop(,, MerkleClaim calldata _node,) public {
+       if (msg.sender != _node.recipient) revert NotAirdropOwner();
//..
//..
    }
```
