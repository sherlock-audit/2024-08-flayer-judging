# Risk of NFT Loss Due to Pausable NFT Collections .

## Summary

The Protected Listings contract is vulnerable to loss for users if it accepts pausable NFT collection. When the NFT collection is paused, it can disrupt critical functions, leading to asset lock and inability to recover funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

The contract relies on the ability to transfer **NFTs** for various operations, such as creating listings, unlocking assets, and liquidating under-collateralized positions. If the **NFT** collection is paused, these operations are `blocked`, preventing users from managing their assets effectively. Key functions affected include `_depositNftsAndReceiveTokens`, `withdrawProtectedListing`, and `liquidateProtectedListing`.
```solidity
function _depositNftsAndReceiveTokens(CreateListing calldata _listing, uint _tokensReceived) internal {
    IERC721 asset = IERC721(_listing.collection);
    for (uint i; i < _listing.tokenIds.length; ++i) {
        asset.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _listing.tokenIds[i]);
    }
    // ...
}

function withdrawProtectedListing(address _collection, uint _tokenId) public lockerNotPaused {
    // ...
    locker.withdrawToken(_collection, _tokenId, msg.sender);
    // ...
}

function liquidateProtectedListing(address _collection, uint
_tokenId) public lockerNotPaused listingExists(_collection, _tokenId) {
    // ...
    locker.withdrawToken(_collection, _tokenId, msg.sender);
    // ...
}
```
## Impact

Users may experience loss due to:
- Inability to liquidate under-collateralized NFTs, leading to unrecoverable funds.
- Blocked access to liquidity, preventing users from leveraging their NFTs.
- Missed market opportunities due to the inability to transfer or sell NFTs.

## Recommendation
Implement a mechanism to handle paused NFT
-Allowing users to withdraw their NFTs or funds through an alternative process.
