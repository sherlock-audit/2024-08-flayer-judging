# sunsetCollection will not execute when a listing exists with very large created parameter

### Summary

`collectionShutdown` calls shutdown collection when the collection has to be removed from locker.sol

However it checks if pending listings exist and even if locker is paused, if a listing had very high created time, it'll not be removed and listingCount will stay non-zero

This will permanently DOS `sunsetCollection` from ever being called.



### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L241

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L142

The issue comes where a listing cannot be forcibly removed when `createListings` is called with an impossible to reach value for `created` parameter for the block.timestamp

This causes Listings count to always be non-zero effectively DOSing the `sunsetCollection` method

```solidity
    function _hasListings(address _collection) internal view returns (bool) {
        IListings listings = locker.listings();
        if (address(listings) != address(0)) {
@>            if (listings.listingCount(_collection) != 0) {
                return true;
            }
.
.
.

```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `createListings` with a listing of `created` parameter very higher than block.timestamp is called


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. `sunsetCollection` is attempted to be called from `CollectionShutdown` but fails as the `listingCount` for the collection will always be non-zero

### Impact

The collection can never be sunset

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

have a limit check for the collection listing created or have a method to forcibly remove a listing from `Listings.sol`
