# Tax paid calculation is incorrect when cancelling a tokenid from listings/full tax paid is not transferred  to feecollector when cancelling a tokenid.

## Summary
Tax paid calculation is incorrect when cancelling a tokenid from listings/full tax paid is not transferred from to feecollector when cancelling a tokenid. As a result, users may have to pay more tax than expected/tax paid may be stuck in the listings contact.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Let's assume, a tokenid is listed and tax paid= 0.05 and listing.owner receives 0.95.

2.  Now the tokenid is cancelled from listings by calling the function cancelListings.
 
3.  See the function cancelListings, here assume refund= 0, so requiredAmount = 1-0 = 1 ether, so listing.owner have to pay 1 ether tax and 1 ether is burned from owner again. So the owner have to pay 2 ether to cancel the listing which is unfair.

4. Here owner tax/fees = 0.05 ether, so the owner has to pay 0.05 tax and 1 ether should be burned from the owner. So total 1.05 ether should be paid by the owner for cancelling the tokenid which is fair.

If listing.owner have to pay 1 ether tax(if it is intended) , then there is another bug, see below 


1.Letâ€™s assume, a listed tokenid is cancelled by calling the  function cancelListings.

2. See the  function cancelListings, refund = 0.2 ether(assume), so requiredAmount = 1 - 0.2 = 0.98 ether.

3. Now 0.98 ether tax is paid by the owner and 0.98+0.2 = 1 ether is also burned from the owner.

4. Here the bug is 0.98 ether(tax paid) is stuck in the Listings contract because paid tax is not sent to feecollector. There is also no way to withdraw/send paid tax(cancellation fee) to feecollector in the Listing contract.



## Impact
users may have to pay more tax than expected/tax paid may be stuck in the listings contact.
