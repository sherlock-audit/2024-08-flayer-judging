# Unsafe casting in `InfernalRiftAbove.sol`

## Summary
An unsafe downcast of an integer type was found in the contract where a larger integer type is being cast to a smaller one. This can result in data truncation if the value exceeds the range of the target type. Specifically, the value is downcast from `uint256` to `uint96`, which can lead to loss of significant digits if the original value exceeds the range of `uint96`.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the file `InfernalRiftAbove.sol`, the following line of code is performing an unsafe downcast:

```solidity
royaltyBps_ = uint96(_royaltyAmount);
```

Here, `_royaltyAmount` is downcast from its original type (assumed to be `uint256`) to `uint96`. If `_royaltyAmount` exceeds the maximum value that a `uint96` can store (which is `2^96 - 1`), the higher bits of the value will be truncated, leading to a potential loss of data. This could cause unexpected behavior or financial discrepancies, especially if `royaltyBps_` is used in critical financial calculations.

## Impact
**Data loss:** If the value of `_royaltyAmount` exceeds the maximum range of `uint96`, truncation will occur, potentially leading to incorrect royalty calculations.
**Unintended behavior:** The contract could miscalculate important values related to royalty payments, leading to financial discrepancies or losses.
**Security vulnerability:** If unchecked, this could be exploited by malicious actors who could input large values to manipulate calculations.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use OpenZeppelin's SafeCast library to safely downcast the integer and ensure the value fits within the target type's range. SafeCast will revert the transaction if the downcast causes an overflow:

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/SafeCast.sol";

royaltyBps_ = SafeCast.toUint96(_royaltyAmount);
```
