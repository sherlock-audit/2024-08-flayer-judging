# Claiming proceeds from a collection shutdown can be DOSed

### Summary

Claiming the ETH proceeds from a collection clearance on SudoSwap after it has been shutdown can be DOSed.


### Root Cause

The **CollectionShutdown** contract performs a check ensuring the SudoSwap pool is **not** the owner (using `nft.ownerOf(tokenId)`) of any of the NFTs that the contract listed for sale (`sweeperPoolTokenIds`). This opens an attack vector where a malicious user can buy the NFT from the SudoSwap pool and later front-run calls to `claim()` by sending the NFT to the pool again for sale, buying it back in a back-run transaction.
Since Flayer will be using a bonding curve that starts pricing the NFTs at 4 ETH, applying a linear discount for a period of 1 week till price hits 0 ETH, this attack can be performed at close to 0 cost.


### Internal pre-conditions

Have a collection listed for sale on SudoSwap due to it being shut down.


### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. A collection gets shut down and its NFTs get deposited to a newly created SudoSwap pool to be sold for ETH and the proceeds to be split amongst the holders of the CollectionToken for that collection.
2. Malicious actor (Bob) buys for cheap or even for free an NFT from the newly created pool and holds it.
3. Once all NFTs are sold from the SudoSwap pool, Bob waits for calls to `claim()` or `voteAndClaim()` and front-runs them and transfers the NFT to the SudoSwap pool.
4. Now `collectionLiquidationComplete()` will return `false` for that collection as the SudoSwap pool is still owner of one of the NFTs (`sweeperPoolTokenIds`) listed for sale, and thus making `claim()` and `voteAndClaim()` revert.

```solidity
    function claim(address _collection, address payable _claimant) public nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        // Ensure our user has tokens to claim
        uint claimableVotes = shutdownVoters[_collection][_claimant];
        if (claimableVotes == 0) revert NoTokensAvailableToClaim();

        // Ensure that we have moved token IDs to the pool
        CollectionShutdownParams memory params = _collectionParams[_collection];
        if (params.sweeperPool == address(0)) revert ShutdownNotExecuted();

        // Ensure that all NFTs have sold from our Sudoswap pool
→       if (!collectionLiquidationComplete(_collection)) revert NotAllTokensSold();    

        // ...
    }
```

```solidity
    function collectionLiquidationComplete(address _collection) public view returns (bool) {
        CollectionShutdownParams memory params = _collectionParams[_collection];
        uint sweeperPoolTokenIdsLength = params.sweeperPoolTokenIds.length;

        // If we have no registered tokens, then there is nothing to check
        if (sweeperPoolTokenIdsLength == 0) {
            return true;
        }

        // Store our loop iteration variables
        address sweeperPool = params.sweeperPool;
        IERC721 collection = IERC721(_collection);

        // Check that all token IDs have been bought from the pool
        for (uint i; i < sweeperPoolTokenIdsLength; ++i) {
            // If the pool still owns the NFT, then we have to revert as not all tokens have been sold
→           if (collection.ownerOf(params.sweeperPoolTokenIds[i]) == sweeperPool) {
→               return false;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
```

5. Bob back-runs the `claim()`/`voteAndClaim()` call and buys back the NFT from SudoSwap pool allowing them to keep DOSing the claim functions.


### Impact

Owners of NFTs from a collection that's being shut down will neither be able to receive ETH in exchange for their NFTs, nor get their NFTs back as they are already bought by other people.


### PoC

See **Attack Path**.


### Mitigation

Probably allow for the partial claiming of funds from proceeds from the SudoSwap pool clearance and don't require for all NFTs to be sold in order to split the profits.
