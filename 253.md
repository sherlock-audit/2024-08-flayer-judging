# Lack of support for fee on transfer, rebasing and tokens with balance modifications outside of transfers.

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
in Listings::fillListings, The `transferFrom` function of the `_collectionToken` is used directly. 
This could lead to issues with tokens like USDT, which do not return a boolean value and may not conform to the ERC20 standard. If `_collectionToken` is a fee-on-transfer token or does not return true/false, the transfer will fail.
## Impact
 accounting issues

## Recommendation
use SafeERC20's `safeTransferFrom` method to handle all ERC20 tokens safely.
