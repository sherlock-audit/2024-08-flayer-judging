# Theft of fees before initialization

### Summary

When the fees are deposited for a collection that has a registered pool but not yet initialized, it is possible to steal them.


### Root Cause

The [`depositFees`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/UniswapImplementation.sol#L277) function does not check if the pool is initialized.


### Internal pre-conditions

1. The collection has to be registered but its pool not yet initialized. 
2. Someone has to deposit fees to the pool.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Someone deposits fees (e.g. collateral token) to the pool.
2. The attacker initializes the pool with arbitrary price.
3. The attacker makes a swap from native token to collateral token with arbitrary price and spends a close to 0 amount of native token to retrieve all collateral tokens.

### Impact

Theft of fees.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The [`depositFees`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/UniswapImplementation.sol#L277) function should check whether the pool is initialized and revert otherwise.
