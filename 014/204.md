# The fee set by the setFee() function will not take effect.

## Summary
Since the set fee is not saved in storage, any fee set by setFee() will not be preserved, and the poolFee of _poolId will remain unchanged.
## Vulnerability Detail
```javascript 
 function setFee(PoolId _poolId, uint24 _fee) public onlyOwner {
        // Validate the fee amount
        _fee.validate();
     
        // Set our pool fee overwrite value
@>>        PoolParams memory poolParams = _poolParams[_poolId];
        poolParams.poolFee = _fee;

        // Emit our event
        emit PoolFeeSet(poolParams.collection, _fee);
    }
```
We can see that since poolParams is set as memory, any fee set by setFee() will not be saved, and the poolFee of _poolId remains unchanged. The poolFee of _poolId will never be able to change.
## Impact
The poolFee of _poolId will never be able to change. When attempting to adjust the poolFee of _poolId, this functionality cannot be realized, resulting in users being overcharged or undercharged fees.

```diff

        // Validate the fee amount
        _fee.validate();
     
        // Set our pool fee overwrite value
-        PoolParams memory poolParams = _poolParams[_poolId];
+        PoolParams storage poolParams = _poolParams[_poolId];
        poolParams.poolFee = _fee;

        // Emit our event
        emit PoolFeeSet(poolParams.collection, _fee);
    }
