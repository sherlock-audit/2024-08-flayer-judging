# UniswapImplementation::setFee() will not work.

## Summary
UniswapImplementation::setFee() will not work because new fee is stored in a temporary variable
## Vulnerability Detail
In setFee(), new fee is set on a temp variable (memory) which is a copy from the storage, not the one in the storage itself:
```solidity
   >>>     PoolParams memory poolParams = _poolParams[_poolId];
        poolParams.poolFee = _fee;
```
When the transaction ends, this temp `poolParams` will be erased. As a result, no new fee will be set. 
## Impact
Owners can't modify fee. It could be bad when owners think current fee is too low and want to increase it.

## Recommendation
Consider storing the new fee on the storage memory instead:
```solidity
 _poolParams[_poolId].poolFee = _fee
```
