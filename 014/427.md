# setFee() Fails to Update Pool Fee Due to `memory` Keyword

### Summary

The incorrect use of the `memory` keyword in the `setFee()` function will cause the pool fee to remain unchanged, as modifications are made to a temporary copy rather than the storage variable.

### Root Cause

In `UniswapImplementation.sol` the `setFee()` function uses the `memory` keyword when accessing the `PoolParams` struct, creating a local copy instead of modifying the storage variable.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. UniswapImplementation contract needs to be deployed with the incorrect `setFee()` function implementation.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. **Owner calls `setFee()` to update the fee for a specific pool**
2. **The function executes without reverting, appearing to succeed**
3. **The actual fee in storage remains unchanged**
4. **Subsequent operations use the old, unmodified fee value**

### Impact

The pool fees cannot be updated as intended. This prevents the contract owner from adjusting fees in response to market conditions or protocol requirements, potentially leading to suboptimal protocol performance or loss of revenue.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the `setFee()` function to use the `storage` keyword instead of `memory`:

```solidity
function setFee(PoolId _poolId, uint24 _fee) public onlyOwner {
    // Validate the fee amount
    _fee.validate();

    // Set our pool fee overwrite value
    PoolParams storage poolParams = _poolParams[_poolId];
    poolParams.poolFee = _fee;

    // Emit our event
    emit PoolFeeSet(poolParams.collection, _fee);
}
```
