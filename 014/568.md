# ```setFee``` function is writing on memory leading to protocol not able to apply ```Pool```-specified ```fees``` as intended.

### Summary

The ```UniswapV4Implementation::setFee()```  is supposed to change the swap ```fee``` for a specific ```Pool``` after it's initialization but it is writing to ```memory``` variable, instead of the ```storage``` one, so it is actually not changing anything.

### Root Cause

In ```UniswapV4Implementation::setFee()```, the variable which is changed is ```memory```, instead of ```storage```. Take a look here :
```solidity
    function setFee(PoolId _poolId, uint24 _fee) public onlyOwner {
        // Validate the fee amount
        _fee.validate();

        // Set our pool fee overwrite value
@>        PoolParams memory poolParams = _poolParams[_poolId];
        poolParams.poolFee = _fee;

        // Emit our event
        emit PoolFeeSet(poolParams.collection, _fee);
    }
```

As you can understand, the ```poolParams``` is never, actually, changed.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to change the ```fee``` for a specific pool, as expected, and apply a non zero ```fee``` for the swaps on this ```Pool```, other than default.

### External pre-conditions

1. ```Pool``` to be initialized by someone depositing his tokens and initializing a ```collection```.

### Attack Path

1. Pool is initialized with 0 fee.
2. Owner calls ```setFee``` to specify a ```fee``` for this Pool.
3. ```fee``` for this Pool is not changed, remaining ```0```.

### Impact

The protocol is not able to set a fee for a specific pool since in the initialization of the Pool the fee is set as 0, expected to be change from the ```setFee``` function. As a result, the owner can **not** apply specified fees for different pools breaking a core functionality and source of profit for the protocol.  The impact of this vulnerability is **loss of funds** for the LPs who will not be able to take advantage of different fees for different Pools with, maybe, higher volatility.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To mitigate this issue and, actually, allow the owner to change the fee for a pool, make this change :
```diff
    function setFee(PoolId _poolId, uint24 _fee) public onlyOwner {
        // Validate the fee amount
        _fee.validate();

        // Set our pool fee overwrite value
-        PoolParams memory poolParams = _poolParams[_poolId];
+        PoolParams storage poolParams = _poolParams[_poolId];
        poolParams.poolFee = _fee;

        // Emit our event
        emit PoolFeeSet(poolParams.collection, _fee);
    }
```
