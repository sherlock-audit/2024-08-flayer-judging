# Attacker can frontrun large fee deposits from `fillListing`

### Summary

Fees deposited and distributed to pools can be sandwiched causing loss of funds to real liquidity providers

### Root Cause

The way fees are distributed to uniswap pools is sandwich-able and the hook implementations decrease its probability but don't prevent it especially for bots monitoring the meme pool 

### Internal pre-conditions

Large Fees are going to get deposited from `Listings::fillListings()`

### External pre-conditions

External normal user is swapping directly after the fees deposited in the direction that trigger fees swapping and distribution in `beforeSwap` Hook

### Attack Path

in `Listings::fillListings()` a user can fill multiple listing at a time

The listings is filled by looping through every id listed calling `_fillListing()`

in the internal `_fillListing()` the paid fee of the listing is built up through adding the fee to the transient storage [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L508) 

After the loop end we get the total amount of Fee here
```solidity
File: Listings.sol
595:         uint fillFee = _tload(FILL_FEE);
596:         if (fillFee != 0) {
597:             _collectionToken.approve(address(locker.implementation()), fillFee);
598:             locker.implementation().depositFees(collection, 0, fillFee);
599:             assembly { tstore(FILL_FEE, 0) }
600:         }
```
And we deposit it in Line 598 at one time.

Large listings filled that can have variable fees associated with it according to its time of listing 

Attacker (bot) see this large sweep of a whale and sees it profitable

He front runs the trade and deposit liquidity to the uniswap pool, the `beforeAddLiquidity` gets triggered but he doesn't care about old fees, he is targeting new fees added by this large trade

Now the attacker is free to wait till `beforeSwap` gets triggered  to swap the fee to `nativeToken` or it can be by coincidence that there is a swap coming in the pool in the direction that convert the `collectionToken` fee to `nativeToken` 

Either way, generally large trades are sandwiched for profit

The steps can be as follows
1. Large `fillListings` is in meme pool
2. Attacker sees it profitable, now there is two scenarios
   1. He already has alot of floor NFTs and will deposit them in `Locker` to get alot of `collectionTokens` and deposit with them the `nativeToken` to the pool
   2. Or he doesn't already have NFTs for that collection then he can
      1. Buy alot of `collectionToken` from the uniswap Pool or sweep Multiple floor NFT and `deposit` them in the `locker` to get `collectionTokens`, what ever more profitable
        2. Deposit liquidity in the pool to sandwich the trade
        3. Remove the liquidity and convert all bough items back to His desired token
3. Now if there is no swaps already so that fees are converted to nativeTokens and distributed he can wait as liquidity provider or make a swap him self in the direction of swapping the fees and swap it back in the opposite direction after fees are distributed
   
> **_!Note_**: Steps above have alot of external conditions to show that there are multiple instances that this attack is feasible, but this doesn't mean that the attack isn't feasible in less constrained environment

### Impact

Real liquidity providers will lose large portion of fees provided

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Hook implementation really decreased the probability but didn't prevent it

It can be better to remove the distribution system and directly `donate()` them through a bot with Private Pool

If the above recommendation is not feasible, then Linear curve implementation can be used to slowly distribute fees what ever its size.
