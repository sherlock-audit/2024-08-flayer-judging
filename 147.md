# `_distributeFees` will not work because of missing donate hooks

## Summary
In UniswapImplementation.sol the _distributeFees function will always rever
## Vulnerability Detail
As we can see here in `BaseHook` the donate functions have the following implementation:
```solidity 
 function beforeDonate(address, PoolKey calldata, uint256, uint256, bytes calldata)
        external
        virtual
        returns (bytes4)
    {
        revert HookNotImplemented();
    }

    function afterDonate(address, PoolKey calldata, uint256, uint256, bytes calldata)
        external
        virtual
        returns (bytes4)
    {
        revert HookNotImplemented();
    }
```
However since they are not overriden in the `UniswapImplementation` the following line will always revert:
```solidity
 BalanceDelta delta = poolManager.donate(_poolKey, amount0, amount1, '');
``` 
because of the following hook triggers in the poolManager:
