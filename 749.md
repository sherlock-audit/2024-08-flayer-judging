# Frontrun of execute can lead the DOS of voting

## Summary

An attacker can prevent a fair vote from completing in `CollectionShutdown` by frontrunning `execute`.

## Vulnerability Detail

Since anyone can call `cancel()` in `CollectionShutdown.sol` it is possible to frontrun execution of `execute()` function, which allows an attacker to prevent a fair vote from being completed.

Attack scenario:

1. Collection holders vote,
2. The number of votes reaches `quorumVotes` and `canExecute` becomes `true`,
3. `Owner` calls `execute`,
4. The attacker front-runs the `Owner`'s transaction with their own, in which they call `cancel`,
5. The fair vote is cancelled, it needs to be started again, the attacker can do this as many times as they want since the attack doesn't require significant resources.

## Impact

DoS of voting, users have to withdraw their votes and vote again, which in turn causes gas expenses

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To avoid these risks, in our opinion, one of the following solutions can be used:

1. Remove the ability for anyone to cancel the voting, delegate such rights either only to the `Owner` or, at the very least, to a collection holder, which will reduce the risks of such attack scenarios, but this only increases the cost of the attack, as the attacker would need to be a collection holder
2. To completely eliminate such risks - it is necessary to remove the `cancel` function as this is generally a strange solution, considering that one person can decide for all collection holders.
