# Immutable bonding curve in `CollectionShutdown` can be removed from SudoSwap whitelist

## Summary
The bonding curve used when calling SudoSwap's factory for ERC721/eth pairs is immutable and hardcoded which is problematic.
## Vulnerability Detail
Once a collection shutdown is executed, the NFTs are [sent into a SudoSwap pool](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L263) to be sold. If we examine the [data passed](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L478-L492) to create the pool we'll see that the Bonding Curve pricing logic is hardcoded:

```solidity
    function _createSudoswapPool(IERC721 _collection, uint[] calldata _tokenIds) internal returns (address) {
        return address(
            pairFactory.createPairERC721ETH({
                _nft: _collection,
@>              _bondingCurve: curve,
                _assetRecipient: payable(address(this)),
                _poolType: ILSSVMPair.PoolType.NFT,
                _delta: uint128(block.timestamp) << 96 | uint128(block.timestamp + 7 days) << 64,
                _fee: 0,
                _spotPrice: 500 ether,
                _propertyChecker: address(0),
                _initialNFTIDs: _tokenIds
            })
        );
    }
```

And the bonding curve address is [immutable](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L78) and set in the [constructor](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L106). There is no way to set a new one/update it once the contract is deployed.

But if we take a look at [sudo swap factory's function](https://github.com/sudoswap/lssvm2/blob/1b18945b6c8f3e74052ffae0385bd2640d167e81/src/LSSVMPairFactory.sol#L135-L158) the following check is present:

```solidity
    if (!bondingCurveAllowed[_bondingCurve]) revert LSSVMPairFactory__BondingCurveNotWhitelisted();
```

If the bonding curve is [removed from the whitelist](https://github.com/sudoswap/lssvm2/blob/1b18945b6c8f3e74052ffae0385bd2640d167e81/src/LSSVMPairFactory.sol#L453-L461) then that would completely brick shutting down collections in Flayer since its immutable and hardcoded. Whitelisting of the bonding curve in Sudo Swap is out of the hands of the Flayer Protocol, and is not admin error. The flaw is not allowing the bonding curve to be updated which will break the external call, due to this I believe medium severity is warranted.
## Impact
Complete DOS of collection shutdown contract, rendering it unusable for as long as the bonding curve is not whitelisted.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    if (!bondingCurveAllowed[_bondingCurve]) revert LSSVMPairFactory__BondingCurveNotWhitelisted();
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Allow the admin to pass what bonding curve address to use in `execute()` as the function is access controlled to `onlyOwner` anyway.
