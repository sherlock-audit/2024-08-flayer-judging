# Incorrect index due to not emptying tstore

## Summary
An incorrect index of the checkpoint is used when creating a Protected Listing because the tstore opcode is not emptied after the use.

## Vulnerability Detail
The tstore opcode is temporary but not emptied after until the end of the transaction. Hence if a user creates multiple protectedListings in the same transaction the same checkpointIndex will be used for all the listings except the first.

**POC**
- User creates a ProtectedListing the checkpoint is updated with the current checkpoint 
- User creates another ProtectedListing in the same transaction leading to the same checkpoint been used for listing 2
- User can continuously do this and all subsequent listings will have the same checkpoint

## Impact
The listing checkpoint index is used to calculate the unlock price of a user's NFT, as such this will result in listings with lower price.

## Recommendation
