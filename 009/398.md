# Using ERC721.transferFrom() instead of safeTransferFrom() may cause the user's NFT to be frozen in a contract that does not support ERC721

## Summary
in the `locker.sol` the function `redeem` sends the nft to an arbitrary address put by the user, There are certain smart contracts that do not support **ERC721**, so using `transferFrom()` may result in the **NFT** being sent to such contracts.
## Vulnerability Detail
In `redeem`, `_recipient` is a param from the user's input.
Anyone with an ERC20 collection can redeem this floor NFT.

However, if `_recipient` is a contract address that does not support ERC721, the NFT can be frozen in that contract.

As per the documentation of EIP-721:

*A wallet/broker/auction application MUST implement the wallet interface if it will accept safe transfers.*

## Impact
-The  **NFT** may get stuck in the contract that does support `ERC721`.
