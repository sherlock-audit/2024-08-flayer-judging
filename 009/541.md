# potential loss of NFTs should the recipient is unable to handle the sent ERC721s.

### Summary

NFTs could be permanently lost due to 

### Root Cause

The `transferFrom()` method is used instead of `safeTransferFrom()`, which I assume is a gas-saving measure. I however argue that this isnâ€™t recommended and could lead to loss of NFTs because:

the recipient could have logic in the `onERC721Received()` function used to ensure that the recipient can safely receive the NFT, which is only triggered in the `safeTransferFrom()` function and not in `transferFrom()`

one of such instances where this could be a problem for the users is in the [`Locker::redeem(...)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L226) function where the user enters their desired recipient which may not be the account that the user initially made the deposit from, and also [`Locker::withdrawToken(...)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L353-L355)

```solidity
File: Locker.sol
209: @>  function redeem(address _collection, uint[] calldata _tokenIds, address _recipient) public nonReentrant whenNotPaused collectionExists(_collection) {
210:         uint tokenIdsLength = _tokenIds.length; 

SNIP      .........
224: 
225:             // Transfer the collection token to the caller
226:   @>        collection.transferFrom(address(this), _recipient, _tokenIds[i]);
227:         }
228: 
229:         emit TokenRedeem(_collection, _tokenIds, msg.sender, _recipient);
230:     }



353:     function withdrawToken(address _collection, uint _tokenId, address _recipient) public {
354:         if (!lockerManager.isManager(msg.sender)) revert CallerIsNotManager();
355:  @>     IERC721(_collection).transferFrom(address(this), _recipient, _tokenId); // @audit use of unsafe transfer can lead to losses
356:     }

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

There is a warning from [Openzepelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721-transferFrom-address-address-uint256-) against the use of its `transferFrom(...)` method

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

NFTs could get lost when they are being sent out to users wallets

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Replace all instances of OpenZepelin `transferFrom(...)` with `safeTransferFrom(...)` **when tokens are being transferred out to a user**
