# Using ERC721.transferFrom() instead of safeTransferFrom() may cause the user's NFT to lost

## Summary
Using ERC721.transferFrom() instead of safeTransferFrom() may cause the user's NFT to lost

## Vulnerability Detail
Locker:swap/redeem/swapBatch/withdrawToken doesn't use safe transferFrom for transferring NFT to user. In case if receiver doesn't support ERC721, token will be lost.

As per the documentation of EIP-721:
> A wallet/broker/auction application MUST implement the wallet interface if it will accept safe transfers.

## Impact
The NFT may get stuck in the contract that does support ERC721.
