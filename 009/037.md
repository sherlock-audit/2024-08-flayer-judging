# Use safeTransferFrom() instead of transferFrom() for outgoing erc721 transfers

## Summary
It is recommended to use `safeTransferFrom()` instead of `transferFrom()` when transferring ERC721s out of the vault.

## Vulnerability Detail
The transferFrom() method is used instead of safeTransferFrom(), which I assume is a gas-saving measure. I however argue that this isn’t recommended because:

  [OpenZeppelin’s documentation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721-transferFrom-address-address-uint256-) discourages the use of `transferFrom()`; use `safeTransferFrom()` whenever possible
    The recipient could have logic in the `onERC721Received()` function, which is only triggered in the `safeTransferFrom()` function and not in `transferFrom()`. 

It helps ensure that the recipient is indeed capable of handling ERC721s.

## Impact

While unlikely because the recipient is the function caller, there is the potential loss of NFTs should the recipient be unable to handle the sent ERC721s.
