# Use safeTransferFrom instead of transferFrom for ERC721 transfers

## Summary
Use safeTransferFrom instead of transferFrom for ERC721 transfers
## Vulnerability Detail
Use of `transferFrom` method for ERC721 `transfer` is discouraged and recommended to use `safeTransferFrom` whenever possible by OpenZeppelin. 
[OpenZeppelinâ€™s documentation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721-transferFrom-address-address-uint256-) itself discourages the use of `transferFrom()`, use `safeTransferFrom()` whenever possible
This is because `transferFrom()` cannot check whether the receiving address know how to handle ERC721 tokens.
## Impact
If this reciever is a contract and is not aware of incoming ERC721 tokens, the sent token could be locked up in the contract forever.
