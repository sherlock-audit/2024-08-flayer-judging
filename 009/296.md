# Using unsafe `transferFrom` for ERC721 may get tokens lost

### Summary

From [EIP-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721):

```solidity
/// @notice Transfer ownership of an NFT -- THE CALLER IS RESPONSIBLE
///  TO CONFIRM THAT `_to` IS CAPABLE OF RECEIVING NFTS OR ELSE
///  THEY MAY BE PERMANENTLY LOST
/// ...
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;
```

Nevertheless, in quite a few places `transferFrom` is employed to transfer ERC-721 NFTs to _external parties_; e.g.:

- [Listings::relist](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L657)
- [Locker::redeem](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L226)
- [AirdropRecipient::claimAirdrop](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/AirdropRecipient.sol#L138)
- [InfernalRiftAbove::returnFromTheThreshold](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/moongate/src/InfernalRiftAbove.sol#L232)
- [InfernalRiftBelow::_thresholdCross721](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/moongate/src/InfernalRiftBelow.sol#L265)

Any of this calls may result in sending an NFT token to a recipient which is a contract, but is not able or _not ready to receive the token now_.

Notice that while the first case (specifying a contract not able to receive tokens) may be regarded as a user mistake; the second case (an external contract generally able to receive, but not able to do so at this specific moment) is a valid external condition, and thus it is a grave mistake from the protocol to send the NFT tokens nevertheless; in this case the transaction should revert, but instead the NFT token gets lost.

### Root Cause

Usage of `transferFrom` instead of `safeTransferFrom` for ERC-721 token transfers.

### Internal pre-conditions

none

### External pre-conditions

The external recipient of an ERC-721 token is a contract, which either not able or _not ready to receive the token now_ due to the state of that contract.

### Impact

ERC-721 tokens may get permanently lost.

### PoC

Not required

### Mitigation

Employ `safeTransferFrom` instead of `transferFrom` for ERC-721 tokens.
