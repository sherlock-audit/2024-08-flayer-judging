# cloneDeterministic failed will result in createCollection function being stuck indefinitely

### Summary

The `createCollection` function in `Locker.sol` does not handle the scenario where the target clone address is already deployed. In such a case, the function will revert, causing `createCollection` to be stuck indefinitely.

### Root Cause

[LibClone.sol:222](https://github.com/Vectorized/solady/blob/68f546102a386b860f6a8af4cb043b4266268400/src/utils/LibClone.sol#L222)
[Locker.sol:311](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L311)
The problem arises when `cloneDeterministic` is invoked, revealing both the `tokenImplementation` and `salt` publicly. The `_collectionCount` can only be modified during the `createCollection` call. If the target clone address is already deployed, the function will revert. Malicious users might also try to deploy a `cloneDeterministic` contract with the same `salt` and `tokenImplementation` to a specific address due to the public disclosure of these values.

### External pre-conditions

the target clone address has already been deployed.

### Impact

The `createCollection` function cannot be called successfully anymore

### Mitigation

- To resolve the problem, incorporate a try-catch block. If the target clone address is already deployed, try incrementing `_collectionCount++` to create a new clone address. 
- Another solution is to introduce a `setCollectionCount` function to specify a particular value for `_collectionCount`, which can also mitigate the issue.
