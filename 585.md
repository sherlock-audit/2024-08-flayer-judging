# M-4 Uninitialized State Variable

## Summary

Using uninitialized state variables may lead to unexpected behavior.

## Vulnerability Detail

What is the Uninitialized State Variable vulnerability?
In Solidity, smart contracts may define various state variables at the level of the contract itself, analogous to class members in many object-oriented programming languages. State variables will have default values dictated by the EVM if the variables are not initialized; these may be desired values in some cases, but they may be unexpected in other cases, and failure to initialize them will not prevent a smart contract from compiling even if lack of initialization leads to a logical bug.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Solidity does initialize variables by default when you declare them, however it's good practice to explicitly declare an initial value. For example, if you transfer money to an address we must make sure that the address has been initialized.

 Always ensure that state variables receive proper values in the contract declaration or via the constructor.
