# Arithmetic underflow and type mismatch in refund calculation leading to transaction reversion

## Summary
An arithmetic overflow/underflow and type mismatch issue was identified in the calculation of `refund_` in `Listings::_resolveListingTax`, which can cause the contract to revert during execution. This vulnerability arises from mixing unsigned integer types of different sizes and performing unsafe arithmetic operations.

## Vulnerability Detail
The following line of code contains a potential vulnerability:

```solidity
refund_ = (_listing.duration - (block.timestamp - _listing.created)) * taxPaid / _listing.duration;
```

The key issues include:

**1. Underflow Risk:** The operation `block.timestamp - _listing.created` can result in an underflow if `block.timestamp` is earlier than `_listing.created`. Since both variables are unsigned integers, underflows will cause the transaction to revert.

**2. Type Mismatch:** The variables `_listing.duration` (uint32), `_listing.created` (uint40), and `refund_` (uint256) are of different types, leading to potential type mismatches when performing arithmetic. Solidity does not automatically cast between different unsigned integer types, causing runtime errors unless explicit casting is applied.

## Impact
- If the subtraction `block.timestamp - _listing.created` underflows, the transaction will revert, leading to a complete failure of the function execution. This would stop the intended logic and could cause disruption to users of the contract.
- Type mismatch between unsigned integers of different sizes can also lead to reversion at runtime, further preventing successful execution of the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Ensure explicit type casting to uint256 for all variables involved in the calculation to avoid type mismatch errors. Refactor the code as follows:

```solidity
refund_ = (uint256(_listing.duration) - (block.timestamp - uint256(_listing.created))) * uint256(taxPaid) / uint256(_listing.duration);
```

2. Consider adding checks to prevent potential underflow, such as:

```solidity
require(block.timestamp >= _listing.created, "Invalid timestamp: block.timestamp is earlier than creation time.");
```
