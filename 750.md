# The struct CreateListing exists two times which can cause shadowing and unexepcted behavior

### Summary

There are two structs called CreateListing, this can cause one to shadow the other.

### Root Cause

```solidity
    struct CreateListing {
        address collection;
        uint[] tokenIds;
        Listing listing;
    }// IListings.sol

    struct CreateListing {
        address collection;
        uint[] tokenIds;
        ProtectedListing listing;
    } // IProtectedListings.sol
```
As we can see there are 2 structs both called CreateListing being imported both in the listings contract.
```solidity
@> import {IListings} from '@flayer-interfaces/IListings.sol';
import {ILocker} from '@flayer-interfaces/ILocker.sol';
@> import {IProtectedListings} from '@flayer-interfaces/IProtectedListings.sol'; 
// Listings.sol
```
As the compiler imports both of them this can cause shadowing(not allowing one to run) or not compile at all.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A user calls the function createListings which uses the struct CreateListings
2. This causes unexpected behavior/fails unexpectedly


### Impact

This could render the function useless, get unexpected behavior or the compiler wont compile.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Change the name of one of the structs.
