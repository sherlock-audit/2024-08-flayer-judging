# Incorrect Handling of Sudoswap Pool Creation Will Cause Permanent Locking of NFTs for Token Holders

### Summary

The improper use of parameters in the _createSudoswapPool function will cause permanent locking of NFTs for token holders as the Sudoswap pool creation parameters are incorrectly set, resulting in NFTs being inaccessible.

### Root Cause

In CollectionShutdown.sol:478, the Sudoswap pool creation logic uses incorrect or arbitrary values for the delta and spotPrice parameters, which can cause NFTs to be locked or not sellable.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin calls execute() to initiate the liquidation process.
2. The locker.withdrawToken() successfully transfers NFTs to the contract.
3. The _createSudoswapPool() uses arbitrary delta and spotPrice values during pool creation.

### External pre-conditions

1. Sudoswap protocol must accept the incorrect pool parameters.
2. The Sudoswap pool remains unsold due to improper pricing or timing.

### Attack Path

1. Admin initiates the execute() function with token IDs.
2. NFTs are transferred to the contract and the _createSudoswapPool() is called.
3. The pool is created using arbitrary values for spotPrice (500 Ether) and delta, making the NFTs inaccessible or unsellable.
4. Users are unable to claim their proceeds as the NFTs remain unsold in the Sudoswap pool.

### Impact

The token holders suffer a permanent loss of NFTs as they become locked in an unsellable pool. The protocol may not recover the ETH from liquidation, and the user gains nothing.

### PoC

```solidity
function _createSudoswapPool(IERC721 _collection, uint[] calldata _tokenIds) internal returns (address) {
    return address(
        pairFactory.createPairERC721ETH({
            _nft: _collection,
            _bondingCurve: curve,
            _assetRecipient: payable(address(this)),
            _poolType: ILSSVMPair.PoolType.NFT,
            _delta: uint128(block.timestamp) << 96 | uint128(block.timestamp + 7 days) << 64,
            _fee: 0,
            _spotPrice: 500 ether, // Arbitrary value, may not reflect true market price
            _propertyChecker: address(0),
            _initialNFTIDs: _tokenIds
        })
    );
}
```

### Mitigation

Ensure that the spotPrice and delta values are dynamically set based on current market conditions and pricing logic, such as using an oracle for pricing. Replace the hardcoded values with more realistic and market-driven values
