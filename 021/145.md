# Token name can be changed which will break domain separator dependent functionalities.

## Summary

Collection tokens hold the `setMetadata` function which allows token owner to change name. However, this is done without changing the token's domainSeparator, which will break the contract's permit functionality.

## Vulnerability Detail

In CollectionToken.sol, the token name and symbol can be updated. However, when this is done, the `name` that is used to calculate the eip712 `_domainSeparatorV4` is not updated making it different from the set during initialization. According to the EIP-712 in case if name, version or any other fields in the _DOMAIN_SEPARATOR is changed, then all previous signatures should not be valid anymore.

```solidity
    function setMetadata(string calldata name_, string calldata symbol_) public onlyOwner {
        _name = name_;
        _symbol = symbol_;

        emit MetadataUpdated(_name, _symbol);
    }
```

## Impact

So as a result, permit transactions and vote delegation functionalities involving the domain separator will break since the domain seprators are now different.
