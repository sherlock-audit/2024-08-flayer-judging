# Changing the name of CollectionToken will break the permit functionality

### Summary

In `CollectionToken.sol`, the contract offers ability for the owner to update the metadata by calling `setMetadata(...)` function. If the name of the token is update, it will break the permit functionality.

The reason is, `CollectionToken.sol` derives from `ERC20PermitUpgradeable` contract and during initialisation, the name for the symbol is passed to ` __ERC20Permit_init(name_)` function which internally sets the storage value for EIP712 base contract.

The signature related domain is build using `eip712Domain()` which relies on the value of the name during initialization. So the `CollectionToken.sol` changes the name to a different value, than the permit will revert due to mismatch.

Hence the `permit(...)` function will stop working. 

 

### Root Cause

`Locker::setCollectionTokenMetadata()` can update the name of the ERC20 token. This call is available to the owner of the locker. This will break the permit functionality as described below.

Lets start with `CollectionToken.sol` contract that initialises the inheritance hierarchy. In the below code snippet, `__ERC20Permit_init(name_)` is the impacted function that handles the EIP712 specification.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/CollectionToken.sol#L49-L62 

In the `__ERC20Permit_init(name_)` , it invokes `__EIP712_init_unchained(name, "1")` function of `EIP712Upgradeable` contract. 

```solidity
 function __ERC20Permit_init(string memory name) internal onlyInitializing {
 ==>       __EIP712_init_unchained(name, "1");
 }
```
In the below function, note how `name` is set for a discrete location for EIP712 storage.

```solidity
    function __EIP712_init_unchained(string memory name, string memory version) internal onlyInitializing {
        EIP712Storage storage $ = _getEIP712Storage();
  ==>      $._name = name;
        $._version = version;

        // Reset prior values in storage if upgrading
        $._hashedName = 0;
        $._hashedVersion = 0;
    }
```

This name is used while building the domain string for permit validation as below.

```solidity
 function eip712Domain()
        public
        view
        virtual
        returns (
            bytes1 fields,
            string memory name,
            string memory version,
            uint256 chainId,
            address verifyingContract,
            bytes32 salt,
            uint256[] memory extensions
        )
    {
        EIP712Storage storage $ = _getEIP712Storage();
        // If the hashed name and version in storage are non-zero, the contract hasn't been properly initialized
        // and the EIP712 domain is not reliable, as it will be missing name and version.
        require($._hashedName == 0 && $._hashedVersion == 0, "EIP712: Uninitialized");

        return (
            hex"0f", // 01111
     ==>       _EIP712Name(),
            _EIP712Version(),
            block.chainid,
            address(this),
            bytes32(0),
            new uint256[](0)
        );
    }

    /**
     * @dev The name parameter for the EIP712 domain.
     *
     * NOTE: This function reads from storage by default, but can be redefined to return a constant value if gas costs
     * are a concern.
     */
    function _EIP712Name() internal view virtual returns (string memory) {
        EIP712Storage storage $ = _getEIP712Storage();
 ==>       return $._name;
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Deploy the `CollectionToken` with a name, say `xToken`
2. Post deployment, as owner of the token, call `setMetadata(...)` and set the name to `yToken`
3. From this point onwards, transaction for this token with offline signature will start to revert.

### Impact

After the `setMetadata(...)` function call, updating the name of `CollectionToken` to a diffferent name from the time of initialization, the permit functionality will stop working of the `CollectionToken`.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Recommendation is to review of  `setMetadata(...)` function is required. It is advised to remove this function if it can be removed.
In the case it cannot be removed, the implementation for `setMetadata(...)`  should update the name  in all the places in the inheritance hierarchy so that every contract in the hierarchy has the new value reflected.
