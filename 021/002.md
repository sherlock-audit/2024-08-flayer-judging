# Broken of EIP712 feature after calling ````CollectionToken.setMetadata()````

### Summary

A contract's ````name()```` is a key field for building EIP712 domain separator, ````CollectionToken.setMetadata()```` can be called to change ````name()````, but the change can't be seen by the inherited EIP712 implementation of ````EIP712Upgradeable```` abstract contract. This would cause:
(1) any EIP712 signatures built with the old ````name()```` still being valid after name changing
(2) any EIP712 signatures built with the new````name()```` being invalid

### Root Cause

The issue arises due to 
(1) both ````CollectionToken```` contract and ````EIP712Upgradeable```` contract defines ````private _name````, and they can't see each other.
(2) miss overriding the ````EIP712Upgradeable._EIP712Name()```` function in ````CollectionToken```` contract, it should return ````CollectionToken````'s ````_name```` for ````EIP712Upgradeable````'s internal usage.

File: lib\openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable\contracts\utils\cryptography\EIP712Upgradeable.sol
44:     string private _name;
...
143:     function _EIP712Name() internal virtual view returns (string memory) {
144:         return _name;
145:     }

File: src\contracts\CollectionToken.sol
...
22:     /// Token name
23:     string private _name;
...
83:     function setMetadata(string calldata name_, string calldata symbol_) public onlyOwner {
84:         _name = name_;
85:         _symbol = symbol_;
86: 
87:         emit MetadataUpdated(_name, _symbol);
88:     }

```
fyi: we can find the inheritance chain by ````CollectionToken-->ERC20PermitUpgradeable-->EIP712Upgradeable```` or by ````CollectionToken-->ERC20VotesUpgradeable-->ERC20PermitUpgradeable-->EIP712Upgradeable````, and the related source link:

### Internal pre-conditions

The admin calls ````CollectionToken.setMetadata()```` to change contract name.

### External pre-conditions
