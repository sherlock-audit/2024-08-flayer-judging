# M-1 Unchecked Block with Subtraction

## Summary

Using subtraction in an unchecked block may silently underflow.

## Vulnerability Detail

What is the Unchecked Block with Subtraction vulnerability?
In modern versions of Solidity, arithmetic operations that would underflow or overflow will now revert by default. However, it is possible to obtain the previous behavior where such operations will wrap rather than reverting, by using an unchecked block. While arithmetic operations inside such blocks may incur lower gas costs, these blocks should be used carefully, as unintended wrapping behavior may lead to program errors if the developer erroneously believes an operation to be safe.
