# Two different Uniswap pools for the same collection if the collection was sunset

### Summary

According to the protocol, there may be situations in which a collection may need to be removed from the platform. This is why the `CollectionShutdown` contract exists. As long as the collection has a listing token associated with it, the creation of another Uniswap pool for the same collection with a different token is not possible. This is enforced in the code in the `Locker::createCollection` [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L304).

```solidity
    function createCollection(...) public whenNotPaused returns (address) {
//..
//..
        // Ensure the collection does not already have a listing token
        if (address(_collectionToken[_collection]) != address(0)) revert CollectionAlreadyExists();
//..
//..
    }
```
Also, the natspec above the `UniswapImplementation::registerCollection` [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/UniswapImplementation.sol#L151) enforces the idea that a collection should not have different tokens and the checks that prevent this from happening must be in the `Locker` contract. Quote "Logic to ensure that the pool does not already exist should be enforced in the preceeding {Locker} function that calls this."

New collections are deployed deterministically, via Solady's `LibClone::cloneDeterministic` passing in the number of collections `Locker::_collectionCount` as the `salt` parameter. The `_collectionCount` is increased after each successfully created collection.

### Root Cause

When sunsetting a collection, the mapping that stores the collection token gets deleted and also the mapping that stores the status of the collection (initialized/ non-initialized) gets deleted. This happens in the `Locker::sunsetCollection` function.

```solidity
    function sunsetCollection(address _collection) public collectionExists(_collection) {
//..
//..
        // Delete our underlying token, then no deposits or actions can be made
        delete _collectionToken[_collection];

        // Remove our `collectionInitialized` flag
        delete collectionInitialized[_collection];
    }
```

This is done to prevent users from interacting with a collection that is about to be shut down and to protect them from unintentionally losing funds.

### Internal pre-conditions

For some reason a collection needs to be shut down, and the voting process is started, the quorum is reached and the `Collectionshutdown::execute` function was called by the owner.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Now that the mappings are deleted, any user can call the `Locker::createColleciton` function, to create a new Uniswap pool for the same collection that was shut down, with a different collectionToken associated with it. This time around, the check `if (address(_collectionToken[_collection]) != address(0)) revert CollectionAlreadyExists();` will not revert because the mappings have been cleared during the `Collectionshutdown::execute` function flow earlier.

Also, since the number of `Locker::_collectionCount` will already be increased at this point, the `salt` parameter sent to Solady's `LibClone::cloneDeterministic` function will be different, and the token that gets created via `create 2` will be different than the initial token, so the function call will not revert, even though the collection argument is the same.

### Impact

I see multiple issues stemming from this:
- It defeats the purpose of having a feature to shut down a collection if anyone can immediately recreate a pool for the same collection that was just shut down.
- Two different Uniswap pools are created for the same collection address, with two different `collectionTokens` associated with it. This is an undesirable outcome for the protocol and this is proven by the fact that the `Locker::createCollection` function checks if the collection token already exists.  The argument is further enforced by the natspec in the Uniswap implementation contract as mentioned earlier.
- User's assets will be scattered. During the `CollectionShutdown::execute` function call any NFTs that are held by the `Locker` contract from this collection will be sent to a Sudoswap pool for liquidation. At this point, some users will have their NFTs in the Sudoswap pool waiting to be liquidated, while others will be able to use Flayer protocol's newly created pool to trade these NFTs. Again an undesirable outcome from the protocol's point of view.
- Having two different Uniswap pools for the same collection with 2 different tokens will fractionalize the liquidity, it is error prone and makes it harder for 3rd party integrations to use these pools.
- There could be lingering states or events tied to the old pool address even after the new pool is created.

### PoC

Add the following test inside the `CollectionShutdown.t.sol` file.
During test deployment in this file, a collection is created on line [35](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/test/utils/CollectionShutdown.t.sol#L35) `locker.createCollection(address(erc721b), "Test Collection", "TEST", 0);`

My test proves that after successfully executing a collection shutdown operation for the `erc721b` collection address, I can create a new Uniswap pool for the same `erc721b` collection and initialize it, but this time the {Collection Token} will be different, otherwise the test must revert and it doesn't.

```solidity
    function test_CreateDuplicatePoolAfterShutdown() public withDistributedCollection {
        //@audit the initial instance of this collection is deployed inside the `constructor` of the test file on line 35.
        // locker.createCollection(address(erc721b), 'Test Collection', 'TEST', 0);
        //check `CollectionShutdown.t.sol::constructor`
    
        // Make a vote with our test user that holds `1 ether`, which will pass quorum
        collectionShutdown.vote(address(erc721b));

        // Confirm that we can now execute
        assertCanExecute(address(erc721b), true);

        // Mint NFTs into our collection {Locker}
        uint[] memory tokenIds = _mintTokensIntoCollection(erc721b, 3);

        // Process the execution as the owner
        collectionShutdown.execute(address(erc721b), tokenIds);

        // After we have executed, we should no longer have an execute flag
        assertCanExecute(address(erc721b), false);

        // Confirm that the {CollectionToken} has been sunset from our {Locker}
        assertEq(address(locker.collectionToken(address(erc721b))), address(0));

        // Confirm that our sweeper pool has been assigned
        ICollectionShutdown.CollectionShutdownParams memory shutdownParams = collectionShutdown.collectionParams(
            address(erc721b)
        );
        assertEq(shutdownParams.sweeperPool, SUDOSWAP_POOL);

        // Ensure that `canExecute` has been set to `false`
        assertCanExecute(address(erc721b), false);

        // Confirm that our tokens are held by the sudoswap pool
        for (uint i; i < tokenIds.length; ++i) {
            assertEq(erc721b.ownerOf(tokenIds[i]), SUDOSWAP_POOL);
        }

        //@audit create & initialize the same collection again
        //@audit this should fail, but it doesn't, meaning a new Uniswap pool was created for the same collection
        locker.createCollection(address(erc721b), "Test Collection", "TEST", 0);
        locker.setInitialized(address(erc721b), true);
    }
```

### Mitigation

Add a "blacklisting" mechanism in the `Locker` contract that will prevent creating a collection for the same collection address if the collection was shut down. This can be a `mapping(address collection => bool) public wasShutdown`. The `Locker::sunsetCollection` function should update the value of this bool and set it to `true` when the collection is in the process of getting shut down. When a user calls the `Locker::createCollection` function add an extra check for this bool. If the bool returns true, it means that the collection was shutdown and no new pools can be created for it.

*any other places that would need this new bool should be updated accordingly.
