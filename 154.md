# Malicious users can reserve NFTs from the pool without any collateral

## Summary
The `reserve` function in the protocol allows users to reserve or re-list NFTs from the pool by providing a specified amount of collateral in ERC20 tokens. However, the function does not validate the input collateral amount, allowing attackers to pass `0` as collateral. This can potentially lead to users reserving or re-listing NFTs without providing any value, bypassing the intended functionality.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user passes `0`as the `_collateral` argument, the `burnFrom` function is called with a value of `0`, meaning that no tokens are burned from the userâ€™s balance. As a result, the user is able to reserve or re-list NFTs without incurring any cost.

Given that the protocol allows re-listing of assets without owning them, this vulnerability allows malicious actors to repeatedly exploit the system, reserving or re-listing valuable NFTs for free.

## Impact
- Malicious actors can reserve and re-list NFTs from the pool without burning any ERC20 tokens as collateral.
- This undermines the economic model of the protocol, as the burn mechanism is essential for maintaining value exchange during the `reserve` process.
- The protocol can suffer from loss of assets or manipulation of listings, potentially leading to mispricing and exploitation of valuable NFTs in the pool.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L690-L759

```javascript
[flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol]
730         collectionToken.burnFrom(msg.sender, _collateral * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination());
731 
732         // We can now pull in the tokens from the Locker
733         locker.withdrawToken(_collection, _tokenId, address(this));
734         IERC721(_collection).approve(address(protectedListings), _tokenId);
735 
736         // Create a protected listing, taking only the tokens
737         uint[] memory tokenIds = new uint[](1);
738         tokenIds[0] = _tokenId;
739         IProtectedListings.CreateListing[] memory createProtectedListing = new IProtectedListings.CreateListing[](1);
740         createProtectedListing[0] = IProtectedListings.CreateListing({
741             collection: _collection,
742             tokenIds: tokenIds,
743             listing: IProtectedListings.ProtectedListing({
744                 owner: payable(address(this)),
745                 tokenTaken: uint96(1 ether - _collateral),
746                 checkpoint: 0 // Set in the `createListings` call
747             })
748         });
749 
750         // Create our listing, receiving the ERC20 into this contract
751         protectedListings.createListings(createProtectedListing);
752 
753         // We should now have received the non-collateral assets, which we will burn in
754         // addition to the amount that the user sent us.
755         collectionToken.burn((1 ether - _collateral) * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination());
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a validation check for `_collateral` to ensure it is greater than zero and meets the minimum required amount for listing reservation.
```diff
+ if (_collateral == 0) revert InvalidCollateralAmount();
```
