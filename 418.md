# Tokens will be stuck due to blacklist logic in some tokens.

## Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/TokenEscrow.sol#L49-L70

## Vulnerability Detail
The provided function does not include a check to ensure that the user is not blacklisted before proceeding with the withdrawal. 
Tokens suck as USDT implements a logic the check if the address is blacklisted and several tokens implement this logic
the issue is that if the user is blacklisted he will not be able to withdraw his token and token will be stuck for ever.

the issue occurs because the withdraw function uses msg.sender to send tokens `SafeTransferLib.safeTransfer(_token, msg.sender, _amount);` 
but to avoid this issue just add parameter eg: recipient where user wants to withdraw his funds.

POC:
```solidity
function withdraw(address _token, uint256 _amount) public {
      // Ensure that we are withdrawing an amount
      if (_amount == 0) revert CannotWithdrawZeroAmount();

      // Get the amount of token that is stored in escrow
      uint256 available = balances[msg.sender][_token];
      if (available < _amount) revert InsufficientBalanceAvailable();

      // Reset our user's balance to prevent reentry
      unchecked {
          balances[msg.sender][_token] = available - _amount;
      }

      // Handle a withdraw of ETH
      if (_token == NATIVE_TOKEN) {
          SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH(msg.sender, _amount);
      } else {
@>>>      SafeTransferLib.safeTransfer(_token, msg.sender, _amount);
      }

      emit Withdrawal(msg.sender, _token, _amount);
}
```

## Impact
user can lose his funds for ever if his is blacklisted.

## Recommendation

```diff
- function withdraw(address _token, uint256 _amount) public {
+ function withdraw(address _token, uint256 _amount, address recipient) public {
      // Ensure that we are withdrawing an amount
      if (_amount == 0) revert CannotWithdrawZeroAmount();

      // Get the amount of token that is stored in escrow
      uint256 available = balances[msg.sender][_token];
      if (available < _amount) revert InsufficientBalanceAvailable();

      // Reset our user's balance to prevent reentry
      unchecked {
          balances[msg.sender][_token] = available - _amount;
      }

      // Handle a withdraw of ETH
      if (_token == NATIVE_TOKEN) {
-         SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH(msg.sender, _amount);
+         SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH(recipient, _amount);
      } else {
-         SafeTransferLib.safeTransfer(_token, msg.sender, _amount);
+         SafeTransferLib.safeTransfer(_token, recipient, _amount);
      }

      emit Withdrawal(msg.sender, _token, _amount);
}
```
