# Users can make Cross-Collection Token swaps

## Summary
The `swapBatch` function enables users to swap multiple tokens in a single transaction to improve efficiency. It is supposed to replace a number of token in the locker vault with an equal number of tokens from the same collection.

## Vulnerability Detail
However, `swapBatch` lacks proper input validation for the validity of token IDs. This could allow malicious users to exploit the system by providing tokens that are from different collections.

## Impact
Users could unknowingly or intentionally swap cross-collection or duplicate tokens. The failure to validate token IDs could result in incorrect ownership transfers, leading to the misallocation of valuable tokens. Furthermore, allowing tokens from multiple collections to be swapped together introduces inconsistency in token management. This could create issues in tracking ownership or adhering to specific rules set by different token collections. 

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L268-L287
```javascript
[flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol]
268     function swapBatch(address _collection, uint[] calldata _tokenIdsIn, uint[] calldata _tokenIdsOut) public nonReentrant whenNotPaused collectionExists(_collection) {
269         uint tokenIdsInLength = _tokenIdsIn.length;
270         if (tokenIdsInLength != _tokenIdsOut.length) revert TokenIdsLengthMismatch();
271 
272         // Cache our collection
273         IERC721 collection = IERC721(_collection);
274 
275         for (uint i; i < tokenIdsInLength; ++i) {
276             // Ensure that the token requested is not a listing
277             if (isListing(_collection, _tokenIdsOut[i])) revert TokenIsListing(_tokenIdsOut[i]);
278 
279             // Transfer the users token into the contract
280             collection.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _tokenIdsIn[i]);
281 
282             // Transfer the collection token from the caller.
283             collection.transferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, _tokenIdsOut[i]);
284         }
285 
286         emit TokenSwapBatch(_collection, _tokenIdsIn, _tokenIdsOut, msg.sender);
287     }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Implement a check that ensures all tokens involved in the batch originate from the same collection.
- Ensure that all token IDs provided in the batch are valid, non-duplicate, and exist in the respective token collections.
