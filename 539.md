# Broken assumption creates path for arbitrage

### Summary

Users can unfairly arbitrage grail tokens with their floor NFTs in the `Locker` contract this is due to broken assumption that 
> assuming that the token being redeemed is of floor value

### Root Cause

The [`swap(...)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L241-L255) allows user to swap tokens deposited into the `Locker` and [`redeem(...)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L209-L230) functions allow users to burn ERC20 and receive the corresponding token of the collection..

The problem is that the protocol wrongly assumes that the token the user is getting out from both of these functions _is of floor value_ **but the functions do not implement a way validate this assumption** and as such, a malicious user can exploit this by 
 - depositing their floor asset and redeeming it for a grail (more rare and valuable) asset
 - swaping a their floor asset for a grail asset

File: Locker.sol
209:     function redeem(address _collection, uint[] calldata _tokenIds, address _recipient) public nonReentrant whenNotPaused collectionExists(_collection) {
210:         uint tokenIdsLength = _tokenIds.length; // @audit 21a) arbitrage between deposit and redeem (user depeosit floor items and redeem grail items because the contract does not place a Tab on which tokens a user deposited)
211:         if (tokenIdsLength == 0) revert NoTokenIds(); // @audit SUGG: implement a check to ensure users can withdraw only the tokenIds[] they deposited and this means placing a tab on the tokens a user deposited
212: 
213:         // Burn the ERC20 tokens from the caller
214:         ICollectionToken collectionToken_ = _collectionToken[_collection];
215:         collectionToken_.burnFrom(msg.sender, tokenIdsLength * 1 ether * 10 ** collectionToken_.denomination());
216: 
217:         // Define our collection token outside the loop
218:         IERC721 collection = IERC721(_collection);
219: 
220:         // Loop through the tokenIds and redeem them
221:         for (uint i; i < tokenIdsLength; ++i) {
222:             // Ensure that the token requested is not a listing
223:             if (isListing(_collection, _tokenIds[i])) revert TokenIsListing(_tokenIds[i]);
224: 
225:             // Transfer the collection token to the caller
226:             collection.transferFrom(address(this), _recipient, _tokenIds[i]); // @audit 22) use of transferfrom could lead to loss of nFT because there is noncheck for whether the recipient can receive NFTs
227:         }
228: 
229:         emit TokenRedeem(_collection, _tokenIds, msg.sender, _recipient);
230:     }


241:     function swap(address _collection, uint _tokenIdIn, uint _tokenIdOut) public nonReentrant whenNotPaused collectionExists(_collection) {
242:         // Ensure that the user is not trying to exchange for same token (that's just weird)
243:         if (_tokenIdIn == _tokenIdOut) revert CannotSwapSameToken();
244: 
245:         // Ensure that the token requested is not a listing
246:         if (isListing(_collection, _tokenIdOut)) revert TokenIsListing(_tokenIdOut);
247: 
248:         // Transfer the users token into the contract
249:         IERC721(_collection).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _tokenIdIn);
250: 
251:         // Transfer the collection token from the caller.
252:         IERC721(_collection).transferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, _tokenIdOut);
253: 
254:         emit TokenSwap(_collection, _tokenIdIn, _tokenIdOut, msg.sender);
255:     }

```

Of course both functions check to make sure that the token is not currently listed as shown on L223 and L246, but there is a possibility that the the redemption could happen between the time when the owner of a grail listing deposits and the time when he lists his token.


Also worthy of mention is, if the token is not listed, then then we cannot safely assume that the token out is of floor value going by the protocol's pricing model.

### Internal pre-conditions

Protocol assumption that _the token being redeemed is of floor value_ is not properly implemented

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- Alice and Bob both own tokens in collectionX
- Alice token is grail (more rare and expensive by open market valuation)
- Bob's token is (more common and bery cheap by open market valuation)
- Alice deposits her token into the locker
- Bob swaps his token for alice token

### Impact

Users can perform unfair arbitrage or worse yet steal tokens form the locker

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider implementing a better algorithm to ensure that token out of both functions is of actual floor value
