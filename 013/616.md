# The absence of a `receive` function in the `ERC721Bridgable.sol` and `ERC1155Bridgable.sol` contracts

## Summary
The absence of a `receive` function in the `ERC721Bridgable.sol` and `ERC1155Bridgable.sol` contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `ERC721Bridgable` and `ERC1155Bridgable` contracts implement `ERC-2981` for handling royalties. The `claimRoyalties` function allows a caller to retrieve native ETH if a zero-address token is passed into the function. However, in order to claim royalties in native ETH, the ETH must first be sent to the contract. The `ERC721Bridgable` and `ERC1155Bridgable` contracts do not have a `receive` function.

```solidity
if (address(token) == address(0)) {
                SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH(_recipient, payable(address(this)).balance);
            }
```

## Impact
The `claimRoyalties` function handles the scenario where native ETH is intended to be paid as royalties, but the user will not receive any ETH because it cannot be sent to the contract.
