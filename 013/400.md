# `ERC1155Bridgable` cannot receive ETH for royalty payouts

## Summary
The contract cannot receive eth. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The `ERC1155Bridgable` contract has a function to [`claimRoyalties()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/moongate/src/libs/ERC1155Bridgable.sol#L116-L135) for a recipient, where if one of the tokens specified is `address(0)` then the royalties are to be paid out in native eth. The issue is that the contract is missing receive/fallback functions as well as any payable function. The contract cannot receive any eth from royalties and cannot pay it out accordingly as well.
```solidity
    for (uint i; i < tokensLength; ++i) {
        // Map our ERC20
        ERC20 token = ERC20(_tokens[i]);

        // If we have a zero-address token specified, then we treat this as native ETH
        if (address(token) == address(0)) {
            SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH(_recipient, payable(address(this)).balance);
        } else {
            SafeTransferLib.safeTransfer(token, _recipient, token.balanceOf(address(this)));
        }
    }
```
## Impact
Loss of funds for end recipient of royalties. Contract cannot receive any native eth royalties.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    for (uint i; i < tokensLength; ++i) {
        // Map our ERC20
        ERC20 token = ERC20(_tokens[i]);

        // If we have a zero-address token specified, then we treat this as native ETH
        if (address(token) == address(0)) {
            SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH(_recipient, payable(address(this)).balance);
        } else {
            SafeTransferLib.safeTransfer(token, _recipient, token.balanceOf(address(this)));
        }
    }
```

## Recommendation
Allow the contract to receive eth.
