# Native ETH royalty can never be claimed by anyone

## Summary
Issue: `ERC721Bridgable` and `ERC1155Bridgable` lacks a receiver function to accept incoming ETH

## Vulnerability Detail
The `ERC721Bridgable.claimRoyalties` in L2s allows you to claim tthe royalties in any token and also in native ETH. Some marketplaces/sales happen in antive ETH, WETH, USDC and so on. But look at line 162, it transfers the ETH balance to the recipient. The issue here is, that the  `ERC721Bridgable` cannot have ETH at all, because it lacks a receiver or a fallback function that accepts the incoming ETH in the first place. So, all the ETH sent to `ERC721Bridgable` will revert, and claiming ETH as royalty is never possible. Issue happens in `ERC1155Bridgable` too.

```solidity
ERC721Bridgable.sol

148:     function claimRoyalties(address _recipient, address[] calldata _tokens) external {
 ---- SNIP ----

155:         uint tokensLength = _tokens.length;
156:         for (uint i; i < tokensLength; ++i) {
157:             // Map our ERC20
158:             ERC20 token = ERC20(_tokens[i]);
159: 
160:             // If we have a zero-address token specified, then we treat this as native ETH
161:             if (address(token) == address(0)) {
162:    >>>          SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH(_recipient, payable(address(this)).balance);
163:             } else {
164:                 SafeTransferLib.safeTransfer(token, _recipient, token.balanceOf(address(this)));
165:             }
166:         }
167:     }
```


## Impact
Native ETH royalty can never be distributed to users, and it's a loss of funds, so high impact. And likelihood of using native ETH as royalty is below medium, so giving medium seevrity.

## Recommendation

Inherit the `Receiver.sol` contract from `solady` that accepts the incoming ETH, ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155.
