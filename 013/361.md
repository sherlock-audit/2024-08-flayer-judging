# `ERC721Bridgable` cannot receive ETH for royalty payouts

## Summary
The contract cannot receive eth. 
## Vulnerability Detail
When an NFT is bridged from L1 -> L2 and the collection does not exist there, the `InfernalRiftBelow` contract deploys an `ERC721Bridgable` [clone of it](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/moongate/src/InfernalRiftBelow.sol#L240-L246):

```solidity
        // If not yet deployed, deploy the L2 collection and set name/symbol/royalty
        if (!isDeployedOnL2(l1CollectionAddress, false)) {
            Clones.cloneDeterministic(ERC721_BRIDGABLE_IMPLEMENTATION, bytes32(bytes20(l1CollectionAddress)));

            // Check if we have an ERC721 or an ERC1155
            l2Collection721 = ERC721Bridgable(l2CollectionAddress);
            l2Collection721.initialize(package.name, package.symbol, package.royaltyBps, package.chainId, l1CollectionAddress);
```

Later if a user has royalties to claim they can [make the request](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/moongate/src/InfernalRiftAbove.sol#L242-L274) from L1 -> L2 and after they're validated, a cross-chain message is sent to forward them to the specified recipient. The L2 contract then invokes the `ERC721Bridgable` clone to [claim royalties](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/moongate/src/libs/ERC721Bridgable.sol#L143-L162):

```solidity
    for (uint i; i < tokensLength; ++i) {
        // Map our ERC20
        ERC20 token = ERC20(_tokens[i]);

        // If we have a zero-address token specified, then we treat this as native ETH
        if (address(token) == address(0)) {
            SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH(_recipient, payable(address(this)).balance);
        } else {
            SafeTransferLib.safeTransfer(token, _recipient, token.balanceOf(address(this)));
        }
    }
```

If token address 0 is specified, the royalties are in native eth and to be paid out. The issue is that the `ERC721Bridgable` contract has no receive/fallback functions, nor any payable function which means it can never receive royalties in native eth. This will lead to a loss of funds for the recipient. 
## Impact
Loss of funds for end recipient of royalties. Contract cannot receive any native eth royalties.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    for (uint i; i < tokensLength; ++i) {
        // Map our ERC20
        ERC20 token = ERC20(_tokens[i]);

        // If we have a zero-address token specified, then we treat this as native ETH
        if (address(token) == address(0)) {
            SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH(_recipient, payable(address(this)).balance);
        } else {
            SafeTransferLib.safeTransfer(token, _recipient, token.balanceOf(address(this)));
        }
    }
```

## Recommendation
Allow the contract to receive eth.
