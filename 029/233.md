# Front-running griefing attack on NFT cross-chain bridging

## Summary
The `InfernalRiftBelow::thresholdCross()` function uses `Clones.cloneDeterministic` to deploy new L2 collection contracts based on the L1 collection address. The `salt` used for deterministic address generation is solely based on the L1 collection address (`bytes32(bytes20(l1CollectionAddress))`). 

## Vulnerability Detail
The `Clones.cloneDeterministic` function is invoked with a predictable `salt`, which is derived directly from the L1 collection address. Since the `salt` is not unique beyond the collection address, it is possible for an attacker to pre-calculate the L2 contract address for any L1 collection.

Even though the function is guarded by the `expectedAliasedSender` check to ensure only trusted calls from the `InfernalRiftAbove` contract can deploy these clones, the predictable nature of the `salt` allows for potential address pre-calculation. Attackers could monitor transactions and front-run operations or exploit the system once the contract is deployed by being the first to interact with it.


## Impact
A malicious actor can front-run every call to `create` and use the same `salt` argument. This will result in reverts of all user transactions, as there is already a contract at the address that `create2` tries to deploy to.

Predictable contract addresses generated from a static `salt` enable attackers to anticipate where the contract will be deployed, giving them the opportunity to front-run the contract or exploit it before legitimate users.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/moongate/src/InfernalRiftBelow.sol#L234-L270

On line 242 we can see that the `salt` used for `create2` is simply the collection address:

```javascript
[moongate/src/InfernalRiftBelow.sol]
234     function _thresholdCross721(Package memory package, address recipient) internal returns (address l2CollectionAddress) {
235         ERC721Bridgable l2Collection721;
236 
237         address l1CollectionAddress = package.collectionAddress;
238         l2CollectionAddress = l2AddressForL1Collection(l1CollectionAddress, false);
239 
240         // If not yet deployed, deploy the L2 collection and set name/symbol/royalty
241         if (!isDeployedOnL2(l1CollectionAddress, false)) {
242 -->         Clones.cloneDeterministic(ERC721_BRIDGABLE_IMPLEMENTATION, bytes32(bytes20(l1CollectionAddress)));
243 
244             // Check if we have an ERC721 or an ERC1155
245             l2Collection721 = ERC721Bridgable(l2CollectionAddress);
246             l2Collection721.initialize(package.name, package.symbol, package.royaltyBps, package.chainId, l1CollectionAddress);
247 
    . . .
```
`Clones::cloneDeterministic()` using the `salt` on line 53:

```javascript
[moongate/lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/proxy/Clones.sol]
45     function cloneDeterministic(address implementation, bytes32 salt) internal returns (address instance) {
46         /// @solidity memory-safe-assembly
47         assembly {
48             // Cleans the upper 96 bits of the `implementation` word, then packs the first 3 bytes
49             // of the `implementation` address with the bytecode before the address.
50             mstore(0x00, or(shr(0xe8, shl(0x60, implementation)), 0x3d602d80600a3d3981f3363d3d373d3d3d363d73000000))
51             // Packs the remaining 17 bytes of `implementation` with the bytecode after the address.
52             mstore(0x20, or(shl(0x78, implementation), 0x5af43d82803e903d91602b57fd5bf3))
53 -->         instance := create2(0, 0x09, 0x37, salt)
54         }
55         require(instance != address(0), "ERC1167: create2 failed");
56     }
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use a `nonce`, `block.timestamp` or unique identifier in addition to the L1 collection address when generating the `salt`. This will ensure that the deployed contract addresses are less predictable and more resistant to front-running attacks.

An example improvement would be to add a block number, timestamp, or a random nonce to the salt:

```diff
+    bytes32 salt = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(l1CollectionAddress, block.timestamp));
+    Clones.cloneDeterministic(ERC721_BRIDGABLE_IMPLEMENTATION, salt);
-    Clones.cloneDeterministic(ERC721_BRIDGABLE_IMPLEMENTATION, bytes32(bytes20(l1CollectionAddress)));
```
