# Usage of price from slot0 in `UniswapImplementation.beforeSwap()` makes swap result easily manipulatable

## Summary
slot0 is extremely easy to manipulate
## Vulnerability Detail
[slot0](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/reference/core/interfaces/pool/IUniswapV3PoolState#slot0) is the most recent data point and is therefore extremely easy to manipulate.

`UniswapImplementation.beforeSwap()` uses `sqrtPriceX96` gotten from slot0 to calculate amount of desired token required at the current pool state to purchase the amount of token specified
```solidity
            // Get the current price for our pool
            (uint160 sqrtPriceX96,,,) = poolManager.getSlot0(poolId);// @audit-issue this is easily manipulatable

            // Since we have a positive amountSpecified, we can determine the maximum
            // amount that we can transact from our pool fees. We do this by taking the
            // max value of either the pool fees or the amount specified to swap for.
            if (params.amountSpecified >= 0) {
                uint amountSpecified = (uint(params.amountSpecified) > pendingPoolFees.amount1) ? pendingPoolFees.amount1 : uint(params.amountSpecified);

                // Capture the amount of desired token required at the current pool state to
                // purchase the amount of token speicified, capped by the pool fees available. We
                // don't apply a fee for this as it benefits the ecosystem and essentially performs
                // a free swap benefitting both parties.
                (, ethIn, tokenOut, ) = SwapMath.computeSwapStep({
                    sqrtPriceCurrentX96: sqrtPriceX96,
                    sqrtPriceTargetX96: params.sqrtPriceLimitX96,
                    liquidity: poolManager.getLiquidity(poolId),
                    amountRemaining: int(amountSpecified),
                    feePips: 0
                });

                // Update our hook delta to reduce the upcoming swap amount to show that we have
                // already spent some of the ETH and received some of the underlying ERC20.
                beforeSwapDelta_ = toBeforeSwapDelta(-tokenOut.toInt128(), ethIn.toInt128());
            }
```

This can be manipulated by an attacker
## Impact
swap result (i.e  amount of desired token required at the current pool state to purchase the amount of token specified) can be manipulated in a way that is detrimental to users and the protocol

[slot0](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/reference/core/interfaces/pool/IUniswapV3PoolState#slot0) is the most recent data point and is extremely easy to manipulate.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To make any calculation use a TWAP instead of slot0.
