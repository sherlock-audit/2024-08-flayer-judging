# User can withdraw all N free NFT from Locker for 1 token + txes instead of N token just in one tx.

## Summary

The Locker stores all NFTs that interact with the protocol. NFTs can enter the locker in the following ways:

- The user lists their NFT for sale in `Listings / ProtectedListings` (these NFTs are locked until the end of the listing). It's worth noting that this method immediately returns `1 Collection Token` to the user.
- The user exchanges an NFT for `1 Collection Token` using the `Locker::deposit` functions (NFTs that enter the contract this way are available for withdrawal from the Locker using `Locker::redeem`, which in turn burns `1 Collection Token` from the user, returning them an NFT (any free NFT that is on the contract))

Thus, the normal behavior of the protocol assumes the following invariants:

- Free NFTs should be in the Locker so that the user can use the redeem function
- 1 FLOOR PRICE NFT = 1 Collection Token (this is especially clear from the logic of the listing, where the user specifies floorMultiple - how many tokens above the floor they should be paid for their NFT, however, they are guaranteed to receive `1 collection token` when sold)

The attack, the essence of which will be described below, allows an attacker to take all free NFTs from the locker for just 1 NFT and a relatively small number of tokens to cover the commission, putting them up for sale. Thus, as a result of this attack, the following will happen.

n - number of free NFTs on the `Locker` contract

- The attacker, using 1 + n * listing_tax collection tokens, can earn n + 1 tokens in one transaction
- All free NFTs of the `Locker` contract will be withdrawn and put up for sale, which means the `redeem` functionality allowing to quickly exchange their NFT for `1 Collection Token` will be unavailable.

## Vulnerability Detail

So, let's describe the attack scenario.

Let's say there are `n` free NFTs currently on the `Locker` contract.

Let's say the attacker has one NFT and `n * listing_tax collection tokens`.

Then the attacker only needs to do the following:

1. List their NFT for sale in `Listings` by calling `CreateListings`, paying `listing_tax` (user NFTs = 0, free NFTs = n)
2. As mentioned above, `CreateListings` returns `1 Collection Token` to the user in the same transaction
3. In the same transaction, the user withdraws 1 free NFT from `Locker`, exchanging it for the token received from `CreateListings` (user NFTs = 1, free NFTs = n - 1)
4. Go back to step 1.

At the end, the state will be as follows. (user NFTs on sell = n + 1, free NFTs = 0)

If in

If in the normal behavior of the protocol, `1 free NFT` would be exchanged for `1 Collection token` which would be burned, then in the case of an attack, this is simply an easy way for the attacker to enrich themselves (tokens that in a normal scenario would simply be burned, reducing totalSupply and driving up the price of tokens, as a result of the attack are simply redistributed to the attacker's wallet from other users). Moreover, this also breaks one of the protocol's functionalities - `Locker::redeem`

## Impact

The possibility of this attack in the Flayer protocol is in many ways similar to the possibility of a Sandwich attack in Uniswap. (It also harms the protocol's economy, moreover, it blocks the functionality of quickly exchanging NFT for 1 token).

However, the Sandwich attack is possible due to the structure of the EVM, while this attack is due to shortcomings in the current economic model/implementation.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Perhaps the simplest way to avoid this problem is to not return 1 token to the user during createListings, but only when the listing is realized.
