# Unrestricted NFT Redemption in redeem() of Locker contact

## Summary
The redeem() does not verify whether the value of the NFTs being redeemed matches the number of ERC20 tokens burned.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function allows users to specify which NFTs they want to redeem without ensuring that the value of the NFTs corresponds to the ERC20 tokens being burned. An attacker could deposit low-value NFTs, accumulate ERC20 tokens, and redeem high-value NFTs.

## Impact
 Attackers could use low-value ERC20 tokens to redeem high-value NFTs, leading to significant financial loss for the contract.
The lack of value matching between ERC20 tokens and NFTs could undermine the integrity of the system.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a value-based redemption mechanism to ensure that the value of the ERC20 tokens burned matches the value of the NFTs being redeemed. You could introduce a whitelist of collections and enforce value-based equivalence:
`require(tokensBurned >= nftValue(_collection, _tokenIds[i]), "Not enough tokens to redeem this NFT");`
