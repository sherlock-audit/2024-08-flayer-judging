# Tautological comparison will always result in true or false

## Summary
The comparison between `_initialCheckpoint.timestamp` and `_currentCheckpoint.timestamp` in the `TaxCalculator::compound` function is a tautological comparison. This means the condition will always be true or always false, making it redundant and possibly indicating a logical error in the code.

## Vulnerability Detail
The comparison:
```solidity
if (_initialCheckpoint.timestamp >= _currentCheckpoint.timestamp) {
```

is used to determine if the `_initialCheckpoint` timestamp is greater than or equal to `_currentCheckpoint` timestamp. However, if the timestamps are expected to be distinct and logically ordered (i.e., the current checkpoint should always have a timestamp greater than or equal to the initial checkpoint), this comparison becomes tautological.

**Issues:**

**- Redundancy:** If the timestamps are supposed to be in increasing order (i.e., `_initialCheckpoint.timestamp` should always be less than or equal to `_currentCheckpoint.timestamp`), this comparison is always true or false and hence redundant.
**- Logical Error:** This comparison may indicate a misunderstanding of how timestamps are expected to be used, or it could imply a logical flaw in the contract's design.

## Impact
**Code Clarity:** The tautological comparison affects code clarity and readability, making it harder for developers to understand the intention behind the code.
**Potential Bugs:** This issue could be symptomatic of a deeper logical flaw or incorrect assumptions in the code, potentially leading to incorrect behavior or results.
**Gas Inefficiency:** Although this comparison itself does not significantly impact gas usage, redundant or unnecessary conditions can add to gas costs if the code becomes more complex.

## Recommendation
Update Comparison Logic: If the condition is needed, make sure the comparison is appropriate and reflects the intended logic. For instance:

```solidity
if (_initialCheckpoint.timestamp > _currentCheckpoint.timestamp) {
    revert("Initial checkpoint timestamp is after the current checkpoint.");
}
```
