# Creating listing with specific listing settings, as high `_floorMultiple` or long `_duration` will be impossible.

## Summary

User can list ERC721 tokens using `Listings::CreateListings` function. To list ERC721 user have to paid listing tax which is calculated by `TaxCalculator::calculateTax` function. Every listed ERC721 is backed by ERC20 token assigned to this collection, user will always receive one ERC20 per ERC721. Tax which user have to pay to list tokens is based on ERC721 `_floorMultiple` and `_duration` of the listing.

## Vulnerability Detail

Assume user want to create listing for 150 days with ERC721 which is not the floor token. User call `Listings::CreateListings` with parameters `_floorMultiple` = 300 and `_duration` = 150 days. User will get 1 ERC20 token equal `1e18 * 10 ** locker.collectionToken(_collection).denomination()` and calculated tax will be higher than `1e18 * 10 ** locker.collectionToken(_collection).denomination()` in this case. Function will revert beacuse of `if` statement - ` if (taxRequired > tokensReceived) revert InsufficientTax(tokensReceived, taxRequired);`.

## Impact

In some cases with specific numbers, as high `_floorMultiple` or long `_duration` parameters, calculated tax will be higher than `1e18 * 10 ** locker.collectionToken(_collection).denomination();` what makes it impossible to create listing.

## Recommendation

Let user pay additional tax if `taxRequired > tokensReceived`.
