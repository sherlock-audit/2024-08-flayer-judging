# There is a problem with the logic of the function that cancels the shutdown process

## Summary
There is a problem with the logic of the function that cancels the shutdown process.
## Vulnerability Detail
When the vote is passed and totalSupply <= MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS, anyone can cancel the shutdown process. At this time, collectionParams will be directly deleted, making it impossible for users to retrieve their collectionToken.
## Impact
The user's collectionToken will be locked in the CollectionShutdown contract.
## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Add the logic of returning collectionToken in the cancel function.
