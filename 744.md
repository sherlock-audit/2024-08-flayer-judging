# a user can use  the relist function to  buy because it is more cheaper than the fillListings

### Summary

in fillListings the caller have to first transfer the  **totalPrice**  and also burn the base amount that the lister received  when listing  but in  **relist** the user only have to Pay   listingPrice - listingFloorPrice and the tax so the base amount that the lister received when depositing is not accounted in here   

### Root Cause

in Listing  function relist   is more cheaper when buying
