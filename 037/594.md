# H-7 Contract locks Ether without a withdraw function.

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
It appears that the contract includes a payable function to accept Ether but lacks a corresponding function to withdraw it, which leads to the Ether being locked in the contract. To resolve this issue, please implement a public or external function that allows for the withdrawal of Ether from the contract.
