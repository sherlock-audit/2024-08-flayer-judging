# Reserve does not work as intended

## Summary
In the whitepaper, reservations are described as user putting up collateral and paying an interest rate. In the code, the user is required to pay the margin to the old listing owner before resrving it, contradicting with the intended purpose of the funciton.
## Vulnerability Detail
The whitepaper states that "Users can reserve items in the pool by putting up collateral and paying an interest rate. Reserved items can then be redeemed at a later dateâ€“useful for users with short-term liquidity issues or anticipating upcoming events such as airdrops". Key takeaways from this:  
1) The only obligation a user has is to put up a collateral and pay interest on it
2) Function is catered for users with short-term liquidity issues

When we observe the code we see different logic being executed  

```solidity
    function reserve(address _collection, uint _tokenId, uint _collateral) public nonReentrant lockerNotPaused {
     
        Listing memory oldListing = _listings[_collection][_tokenId];

        if (oldListing.owner == msg.sender) revert CallerIsAlreadyOwner();

        (bool isAvailable, uint listingPrice) = getListingPrice(_collection, _tokenId);         // fetch current listing price
        if (!isAvailable) revert ListingNotAvailable();


            uint listingFloorPrice = 1 ether * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination();            // fetch floor
            if (listingPrice > listingFloorPrice) {
                unchecked {
                    collectionToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, oldListing.owner, listingPrice - listingFloorPrice);   // @audit user technically almost purchases the listing
                }
            }


            unchecked { listingCount[_collection] -= 1; }
        }


        collectionToken.burnFrom(msg.sender, _collateral * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination());                   // collateral is burnt here
    
```
Assume denomination = 4, floorPrice = 1e22  

Let's put that in numbers - if a user wants to reserve a listing currently priced at 6e22, they have to pay up 5e22 + collateral just to reserve the listing. During reservation, a protected listing is created which is susceptible to liquidations if the user does not pay up their interest, meaning they could lose the NFT completely. For convenience let's say the user puts up 0.5e18 as collateral. A reservation would cost the user 5.5e22 while a direct purchase would cost him 6e22 collection tokens. This contradicts the intended design of the function and makes it impractical to use.  

Essentially, the reservation mechanism forces the user to almost purchase the NFT without giving them the right to it, saves them up a fraction of 1e22 while creating exposure to interest rates. If a user invokes `reserve` and actually has enough balance to cover the old listing owner profit, they will end up paying more than the initial cost which is described as only collateral.
