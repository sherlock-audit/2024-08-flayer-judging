# fillListings is vulnerable to frontun attack

## Summary
When a user attempts to purchase an NFT using the `fillListings` function, a malicious actor can front-run this action by relisting the same NFT at a higher price before the first user completes the purchase. This allows the malicious user to profit from the price manipulation, as the original buyer ends up paying more than they intended.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability arises because the `fillListings` function uses the token price using the latest price at the time of purchase. This price is calculated using `getListingPrice()` and changes based on auction type, duration and other factors, which can change between when the buyer checks the price (via getListingPrice) and when they actually complete the purchase.

A malicious user can exploit this by calling a `relist` function to buy the token at a lower price and relist it at a higher price. Since there is no mechanism to lock the price or cap the amount a buyer is willing to pay, the original buyer ends up paying a much higher price than they intended due to this front-running attack.

## Impact

malicious user to front-run a legitimate buyer, manipulating the price of an NFT and forcing the buyer to pay a much higher price than originally intended

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a parameter to fillListings that allows the user to specify a maximum price they are willing to pay. If the price exceeds this amount during the transaction, the purchase should fail.
