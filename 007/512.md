# Lack of slippage control on functions that allow to buy a listed NFT

### Summary


### Root Cause

The functions [Listings::fillListings()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L528), [Listings::relist()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L625) and [Listings::reserve()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L690) lack price slippage control, which can lead to the callers of these functions spending more than they expect. This is possible because these functions calculate the amount to pay during execution and there's no input that allows to limit this amount.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Caller of [Listings::fillListings()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L528), [Listings::relist()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L625) or [Listings::reserve()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L690) has approved the `Listings` for more collection tokens than they intend to spend. It's not unlikely for users to approve a contract to spend `type(uint256).max` tokens.

### Attack Path

1. Eve creates a listing via [Listings::createListings()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L130) and puts up a rare NFT for sale at `120` floor multiple, which is a great deal. The NFT is currently for sale at `1.2e18` collection tokens
2. Alice notices the good deal and decides to purchase the NFT via [Listings::fillListings()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L528), expecting to pay `1.2e18` collection tokens
3. Eve calls [Listings::modifyListings()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L303) before Alice's transaction is executed increasing the floor multiple of the NFT she listed from `120` to `500`
4. Alice transaction goes through, she gets the NFT but she spends `5e18` collection tokens instead of the `1.2e18` she was expecting

Important to note that this can also happen without any malicious intent as Eve might be modifying her listing without knowing Alice broadcasted a transaction to purchase the NFT.

### Impact

Collection tokens can be stolen from honest users.

### Mitigation

In [Listings::fillListings()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L528), [Listings::relist()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L625) and [Listings::reserve()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L690) include a parameter that indicates the maximum amount of tokens the caller is willing to pay and revert if the price is higher than that.
