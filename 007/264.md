# The `reserve` Function is prone to a Front-Running Attack

## Summary
The front-running Attack occurs when an attacker relisting the token before another user calls the reserve function, thus inflating the listing price and making the user pay more than expected. This is a vulnerability, as it allows the attacker to manipulate the price of the listing and get profit from it.


## Vulnerability Detail
The `Reserve` function enables users to pay a listing price above the floor value directly to the listing owner. However, this creates a vulnerability: an attacker can exploit front-running by intercepting and relisting the same item before the user's transaction is processed. By doing so, the attacker can increase the item's price and become the new listing owner. Now the user is forced to pay a higher price than originally anticipated, leading to unexpected financial costs

## Impact
Attackers may front-run transactions to artificially inflate the price of a Listing, causing buyers to pay more than anticipated and that will profit the attackers as they get that above Floor value.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider implementing a mechanism where users can specify an acceptable price range or tolerance for the listing, similar to slippage settings. This would allow users to define the minimum price they are willing to accept or the maximum price they are willing to pay
