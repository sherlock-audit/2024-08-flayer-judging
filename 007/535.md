# Front-Running Vulnerability in relist Function Allows Fund Theft from Original Relister

## Summary

When an NFT is listed at floor price (e.g., ~ 1.0e18), another user can relist it at a higher price, say 1.2x the floor price (1.2e18), paying the difference between the original and new price to the previous lister. However, this relisting process is vulnerable to a front-running attack.

## Vulnerability Detail
A malicious actor can exploit this by front-running a legitimate relister and setting the price much higher, for example, 3x the floor price (3e18). This forces the legitimate relister to pay the difference between the inflated price and their intended price, sending the excess funds to the malicious actor.

1. Bob lists an NFT at the floor price.
2. Alice attempts to relist the NFT at 1.2 times the floor price.
3. A malicious actor front-runs Alice's transaction by relisting the NFT at 3 times the floor price.

#### Result:
Instead of paying Bob the difference of 0.2 times the floor price, Alice ends up paying the malicious actor the difference between 3 times and 1.2 times the floor price—approximately 2 times the floor price—allowing the malicious actor to steal the excess funds.

## Impact
The legitimate relister ends up paying significantly more than intended due to the front-running, resulting in a financial loss.

## Recommendation
- Minimum Delay Between Relists: Implement a delay or cooldown period between relisting or modifying an NFT's listing. This prevents multiple relist attempts within a short timeframe, reducing the potential for front-running attacks.

- Price Verification: Introduce checks to verify that the relisting price is reasonable and not excessively inflated compared to recent listings.
