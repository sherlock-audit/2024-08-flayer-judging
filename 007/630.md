# Price Manipulation Vulnerability in Listings Contract Leading to Buyer Overpayment

## Summary
The seller can front-run a buyer's transaction to increase the price of a listing, resulting in the buyer losing more money than expected.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `Listings` contract, the seller can modify the price of a liquid listing, or another user can re-list an NFT at a higher price. A malicious user can exploit these functions to front-run a buyer's transaction, increasing the price of an NFT and causing the buyer to lose more money than expected. This attack can be executed with the following steps (similar steps apply for the re-listing function):
1. The attacker calls the `Listings::createListings` function to list NFTs.
2. The buyer, who wants to purchase an NFT, approves the `CollectionToken` for the `Listings` contract and then calls the `Listings::fillListings` function. The buyer may approve a large amount of `CollectionToken` to avoid having to approve it again in future transactions.
3. The attacker monitors this transaction in the transaction mempool. They then send a `Listings::modifyListings` transaction with more gas than the buyerâ€™s transaction to ensure it is executed first, thereby increasing the price of the listing.
=> The attacker achieves their goal.

## Impact
Buyers may lose more money than they expected.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this issue, the `Listings::fillListings` and `Listings::reserve` functions should include input parameters allowing the buyer to pass in the expected listing price. Additionally, logic should be added to check that the listing price stored in the contract matches the price passed in by the buyer.
