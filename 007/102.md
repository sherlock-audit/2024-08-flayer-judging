# Listing owner can frontrun `fillListings()` and `relist()` to increase the token price

### Summary

The missing slippage check will cause the user to overpay for a listing because the listing owner will be able to frontrun their tx and increase the price significantly.

### Root Cause

When a listing is filled, the caller cannot provide a max price, see [Listings.sol:528](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L528). If they have pre-approved enough tokens or have enough tokens in the escrow contract the tx will go through no matter the price of the token. This allows the listing owner to frontrun the user's tx to increase the price significantly.

There should be a param per listing in `FillListingParams` that specifies the max amount of collectionTokens the caller is willing to pay for the listing. Same thing for `relist()`

### Internal pre-conditions

none

### External pre-conditions

- The user who fills a listing or relists an existing listing needs to have more tokens approved to the Listings contract than they need to execute the tx.

### Attack Path

1. The listing owner watches the mempool for a tx where their listing is filled
2. The listing owner increases the price such that they drain all of the caller's collection tokens.

### Impact

The user's funds are drained.

### PoC

none

### Mitigation

Allow the user to specify a max price when they fill a listing or relist one.
