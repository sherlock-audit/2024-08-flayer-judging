# Listings are susceptible to front-running

### Summary

A malicious user can create a listing and **modify its price** when he sees that someone has initiated a transaction to buy it, leading to the buyer overpaying and losing funds.

### Root Cause

There is no `maxPrice` in `fillListings()` and `_fillListing()` or a similar mechanism to ensure that user is not going to overpay when he wants to buy a listing.

### Internal pre-conditions

Floor multiple should not be modified to a price above the max balance of the buying user,
(ex: if the user has x1.7 floor tokens (170 floor multiple), attacker should not modify the listing above 170

### External pre-conditions

Attacker needs to monitor the mempool or have a bot to do so.

### Attack Path

1. User A initiates a transaction to `fill a listing` for the price of 130 floor multiple (100 is the floor price) using fillListings()
2. User B monitors the mempool and sees that User A wants to `buy his listing`
4. User B front-runs User A and `invokes modifyListings()` to change the price to 150
5. User A `buys the overpriced listing`, leaving him with a loss of 20 floor multiple

### Impact

User will pay more than expected, which is a `direct loss of funds`.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a `maxPrice mechanism` or something similar to avoid overpaying
