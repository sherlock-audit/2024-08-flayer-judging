# Malicious users will modify the price of a listing before it is filled to make buyers pay more

### Summary

[Listings::fillListings()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L528) is missing a check to confirm how much the buyer intends to buy, which means it can frontrun the buyer and change the price, making it take a loss.

### Root Cause

In `Listings::528`, there is no slippage check.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Buyer calls `Listings::fillListings()`.
2. Seller frontruns it and increases the price.
3. Buyer gets the nft for a much bigger price.

### Impact

The user takes a loss.

### PoC

```solidity
struct FillListingsParams {
    address collection;
    uint[][] tokenIdsOut;
}

function fillListings(FillListingsParams calldata params) public nonReentrant lockerNotPaused
```

### Mitigation

Set a maximum price.
