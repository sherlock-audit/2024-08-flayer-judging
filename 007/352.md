# Sellers can avoid paying higher tax on liquid listings for expensive NFTs

### Summary

As liquid listings can be modified anytime, this allows to list an NFT at `floorMultiple` 1x so that the tax paid on the listing is the lowest possible, and when someone attempts to buy the NFT the buyer could just modify the listing and set the appropriate (higher) price. The seller might monitor the blockchain or just agree with a buyer in advance when doing that.


### Root Cause

This is possible because taxes are paid in advance on the future value of the listing instead of being collected at the time of the trade. So before a call to **Listings**#`fillListings()`, the seller can simply front-run and call **Listings**#`modifyListings()` for the NFTs being bought, paying tax on the old `floorMultiple` and pre-paying the tax for the new `floorMultiple` but when `fillListings()` is called later they'll be refunded the pre-paid tax, so essentially they are curbing the taxing mechanism.

We can see below how the seller is getting charged in advance the tax for the updated listing with the higher `floorMultiple` (higher `floorMultiple` → higher tax).

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L303-L384
```solidity
    function modifyListings(address _collection, ModifyListing[] calldata _modifyListings, bool _payTaxWithEscrow) public nonReentrant lockerNotPaused returns (uint taxRequired_, uint refund_) {
        uint fees;

        for (uint i; i < _modifyListings.length; ++i) {
            // ...

            // Collect tax on the existing listing
→           (uint _fees, uint _refund) = _resolveListingTax(listing, _collection, false);
            emit ListingFeeCaptured(_collection, params.tokenId, _fees);

            fees += _fees;
→           refund_ += _refund;

            //...
            
            if (params.floorMultiple != listing.floorMultiple) {
                // ...

                listing.floorMultiple = params.floorMultiple;
            }

            // Get the amount of tax required for the newly extended listing
→            taxRequired_ += getListingTaxRequired(listing, _collection);
        }

        // @audit The seller will need to pre-pay the tax on the updated listing with the higher `floorMultiple` but later in `fillListings()`
        // they'll be refunded that pre-paid tax.
        if (taxRequired_ > refund_) {
            unchecked {
→               payTaxWithEscrow(address(collectionToken), taxRequired_ - refund_, _payTaxWithEscrow);
            }
            refund_ = 0;
        } else {
            // ...
        }

        // ...
    }
```

At `fillListings()`, however, we can now follow how the higher pre-paid tax is refunded:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L528-L607
```solidity
    function fillListings(FillListingsParams calldata params) public nonReentrant lockerNotPaused {
        // ...
        
        uint refundAmount;
        // ...

        // Iterate over owners
        for (uint ownerIndex; ownerIndex < params.tokenIdsOut.length; ++ownerIndex) {
            // ...

            for (uint i; i < ownerIndexTokens; ++i) {
                // ...
                
                // @audit Will accumulate the refund amount for the listing in transient storage at slot `FILL_REFUND`
→               _fillListing(collection, address(_collectionToken), tokenId);
            }
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L485-L523
```solidity
    function _fillListing(address _collection, address _collectionToken, uint _tokenId) private {
        // ...
        
        if (_listings[_collection][_tokenId].owner != address(0)) {
            // Check if there is collateral on the listing, as this we bypass fees and refunds
            if (!_isLiquidation[_collection][_tokenId]) {
                // Find the amount of prepaid tax from current timestamp to prepaid timestamp
                // and refund unused gas to the user.
→               (uint fee, uint refund) = _resolveListingTax(_listings[_collection][_tokenId], _collection, false);
                emit ListingFeeCaptured(_collection, _tokenId, fee);

                assembly {
                    tstore(FILL_FEE, add(tload(FILL_FEE), fee))
→                   tstore(FILL_REFUND, add(tload(FILL_REFUND), refund))
                }
            } else {
                delete _isLiquidation[_collection][_tokenId];
            }

            // ...
        }
      // ...
    }
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L918-L956
```solidity
    function _resolveListingTax(Listing memory _listing, address _collection, bool _action) private returns (uint fees_, uint refund_) {
        // ...

→       uint taxPaid = getListingTaxRequired(_listing, _collection);
        
        // ...
        
        if (block.timestamp < _listing.created + _listing.duration) {
→           refund_ = (_listing.duration - (block.timestamp - _listing.created)) * taxPaid / _listing.duration;
        }

        // ...
    }
```

and after the refund is calculated it's being sent out to the seller:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L528-L607
```solidity
    function fillListings(FillListingsParams calldata params) public nonReentrant lockerNotPaused {
        // ...
        uint refundAmount;
        // ...

        // Iterate over owners
        for (uint ownerIndex; ownerIndex < params.tokenIdsOut.length; ++ownerIndex) {
            // ...

            for (uint i; i < ownerIndexTokens; ++i) {
               // ...
               
               _fillListing(collection, address(_collectionToken), tokenId);
            }
            // ...

→           refundAmount = _tload(FILL_REFUND);
            if (refundAmount != 0) {
→               _deposit(owner, address(_collectionToken), refundAmount);
                assembly { tstore(FILL_REFUND, 0) }
            }
            // ...
        }
        // ...
    }
```

### Attack Path

1. Seller lists their NFT for the minimal liquid listing duration allowed – 7 days and for a `floorMultiple` of `100` (1x).
2. There comes a buyer for the NFT, be it a random one or one that the seller agreed in advance with.
3. The seller intends to actually sell the NFT for `floorMultiple` of `500` (5x) but doesn't want to pay the high tax on the listing.
4. Seller calls `modifyListings()` to bump up the `floorMultiple` of the NFT.
5. The listing gets updated and the seller is charged an extra amount for the higher tax for the listing because of the new, higher, `floorMultiple`.
6. The buyer now calls `fillListings()` and pays to the seller `(floorMultiple - 100) ** 1 ether * 10 ** locker.collectionToken(collection).denomination() / 100` and the seller also gets their tax refund back that they just pre-paid.


### Impact

Dishonest sellers can avoid paying higher taxes for more expensive NFTs and thus making LP providers in the **CollectionToken**/`nativeToken` Uniswap pool receive sub-optimal yields.


### PoC

See **Attack Path**.


### Mitigation

Collecting the tax on a listing at the time of the trade taking place will fully curb this issue and will ensure the proper tax is collected on all listings.
