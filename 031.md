# Inadequate Validation of ERC721 Token Transfers in Redemption Process

## Summary
The contract does not validate the successful transfer of ERC721 tokens during the redemption process. Which allows users to redeem ERC721 tokens without burning ERC20 tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `redeem` function transfers ERC721 tokens from the contract to the user using the `transferFrom` method. However, the function does not check whether the `transferFrom` call was successful. If the transfer fails, the function continues execution, assuming the transfer was successful. This can be exploited if a user intentionally or unintentionally causes a transfer to fail, allowing them to retain their ERC20 tokens while still redeeming the ERC721 tokens.
```solidity
209:     function redeem(address _collection, uint[] calldata _tokenIds, address _recipient) public nonReentrant whenNotPaused collectionExists(_collection) {
210:         uint tokenIdsLength = _tokenIds.length;
211:         if (tokenIdsLength == 0) revert NoTokenIds();
212: 
---
214:         ICollectionToken collectionToken_ = _collectionToken[_collection];
215:         collectionToken_.burnFrom(msg.sender, tokenIdsLength * 1 ether * 10 ** collectionToken_.denomination());
216: 
---
218:         IERC721 collection = IERC721(_collection);
219: 
---
221:@=>      for (uint i; i < tokenIdsLength; ++i) {
222:             // Ensure that the token requested is not a listing
---
223:             if (isListing(_collection, _tokenIds[i])) revert TokenIsListing(_tokenIds[i]);
224: 
---
226:@=>          collection.transferFrom(address(this), _recipient, _tokenIds[i]);
227:         }
228: 
229:         emit TokenRedeem(_collection, _tokenIds, msg.sender, _recipient);
230:     }
```

## Impact
Users can redeem ERC721 tokens without burning the equivalent ERC20 tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- After `transferFrom`, ensure that the ERC721 token is transferred to `_recipient` by verifying ownership.
- If the transfer fails, `require` aborts the transaction with the message "Transfer failed", to ensure that only successful transfers are valid.
```diff
function redeem(address _collection, uint[] calldata _tokenIds, address _recipient) public nonReentrant whenNotPaused collectionExists(_collection) {
    uint tokenIdsLength = _tokenIds.length;
    if (tokenIdsLength == 0) revert NoTokenIds();

    // Burn the ERC20 tokens from the caller
    ICollectionToken collectionToken_ = _collectionToken[_collection];
    collectionToken_.burnFrom(msg.sender, tokenIdsLength * 1 ether * 10 ** collectionToken_.denomination());

    // Define our collection token outside the loop
    IERC721 collection = IERC721(_collection);

    // Loop through the tokenIds and redeem them
    for (uint i; i < tokenIdsLength; ++i) {
        // Ensure that the token requested is not a listing
        if (isListing(_collection, _tokenIds[i])) revert TokenIsListing(_tokenIds[i]);

        // Transfer the collection token to the caller
+       address previousOwner = collection.ownerOf(_tokenIds[i]);
        collection.transferFrom(address(this), _recipient, _tokenIds[i]);

        // Check if the transfer was successful
+       require(collection.ownerOf(_tokenIds[i]) == _recipient, "Transfer failed");
    }

    emit TokenRedeem(_collection, _tokenIds, msg.sender, _recipient);
}
