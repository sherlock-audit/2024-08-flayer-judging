# Division by Zero Vulnerability in `getBuyInfo` Function

## Summary

The `getBuyInfo` function in `LinearRangeCurve.sol` has a potential division by zero error, which can occur under specific edge case conditions where the `start`, `end`, and `block.timestamp` are all equal.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function unpacks `start` and `end` from the `delta` value. If `start`, `end`, and `block.timestamp` are exactly equal, the initial conditions do not prevent execution, leading to a division by zero in the line: 

```solidity
inputValue = numItems * (spotPrice * (end - block.timestamp) / (end - start));
```

## Impact

1. **Potential Division by Zero**: This can cause the `getBuyInfo` function to revert and fail, leading to a denial of service for the caller.
2. **Incorrect Pricing Logic**: The function will not be able to compute the `inputValue` correctly, disrupting the expected behavior of the contract.
3. **Security Risks**: Unchecked edge cases can lead to vulnerabilities that disrupt the contract's operation.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/lib/LinearRangeCurve.sol#L38-L77
Here's the portion of the `getBuyInfo` function where the issue occurs:
```solidity
50: if (block.timestamp < start) {
51:     return (Error.INVALID_NUMITEMS, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
52: }

// If the curve has finished, then it's free
55: if (block.timestamp > end) {
56:     return (Error.OK, 0, delta, 0, 0, 0);
57: }

// Determine the input value required to purchase the requested number of items
60: inputValue = numItems * (spotPrice * (end - block.timestamp) / (end - start));
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The edge case where `start`, `end`, and `block.timestamp` are equal is not correctly handled, leading to a potential division by zero. You need to check and correct this issue in the code.
```diff
    // If the curve has finished, then it's free  
    if (block.timestamp > end) {  
        return (Error.OK, 0, delta, 0, 0, 0);  
    }  

+    // Ensure start and end are not equal to prevent division by zero  
+    if (start == end) {  
+        return (Error.INVALID_NUMITEMS, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0);  
+    }  
    
    // Determine the input value required to purchase the requested number of items  
    inputValue = numItems * (spotPrice * (end - block.timestamp) / (end - start));  
```
