# Malicious user can dos swap/swapBatch function and prevent users from swapping.

## Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L241-L287

A malicious user can DOS [swap](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L241-L255) and [swapBatch](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L268-L287) functions by front-running the last token in the batch, preventing other users from executing swaps or batch swaps. 
This issue can occur due to the low transaction fees on the Base chain, making front-running attacks more easy.

## Vulnerability Detail

the issue is that any one can make `swapBatch` function reverts this is because of the low Tx fee on Base chain so any one can make swap batch revert, he can cause revert to 100 `swapBatch` call only with 5$ for example, just by front-run the Tx and swap token with a token userX wants to swap.

lets see this scenario:
1) Alice wants to swap token_(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) with token_(6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
2) Bob sees this Tx and he front-run Alice Tx and he swap his Token_20 with Token_10
3) Alice Tx executes `swapBatch` and the loop swap Tokens when it comes to Token_10
   Tx will revert because the Locker.sol doesn't Own this token anymore, its owned by Bob.
4) Bob will keep abusing the protocol and prevent users from swap/swapBatch tokens.

POC: 
```solidity
function swapBatch(address _collection, uint256[] calldata _tokenIdsIn, uint256[] calldata _tokenIdsOut) 
    public nonReentrant whenNotPaused collectionExists(_collection) 
{
    uint256 tokenIdsInLength = _tokenIdsIn.length;
    if (tokenIdsInLength != _tokenIdsOut.length) revert TokenIdsLengthMismatch();

    // Cache our collection
    IERC721 collection = IERC721(_collection);

    for (uint256 i; i < tokenIdsInLength; ++i) {
        // Ensure that the token requested is not a listing
        if (isListing(_collection, _tokenIdsOut[i])) revert TokenIsListing(_tokenIdsOut[i]);

        // Transfer the users token into the contract
        collection.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _tokenIdsIn[i]);

        // Transfer the collection token from the caller.
@>>>    // because token_10 is not Owned by Locker it cannot send token_10
@>>>    // so it will revert.
@>>>    collection.transferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, _tokenIdsOut[i]);
    }

    emit TokenSwapBatch(_collection, _tokenIdsIn, _tokenIdsOut, msg.sender);
}
```

## Impact

The impact is high because it causes DOS on swap and swapBatch bad user can make them useless and cannot be executed.

## Recommendation

The developers knows better how to fix this issue so it up to them to implement right logic.
