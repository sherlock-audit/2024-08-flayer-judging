# The `sunsetCollection` allows the Reuse of Checkpoints for Re-Created Collections After Shutdown as it does not delete them

## Summary
When a collection is re-created as it is the same address as a previously shut-down collection, the system retains and uses the old checkpoint data. This behavior defeats the intended purpose of the shutdown, which is to reset or remove all associated data for the collection and start anew
## Vulnerability Detail
When a collection is shut down, the system is expected to remove or reset all associated data, including the checkpoint history. However, if a new collection is created with the same address as a previously shut-down collection, the old checkpoint data is retained. This results in the newly created collection inheriting Previous checkpoint information and comparing it, instead of starting with fresh state data, the collection's compounded factor remain tied to the old checkpoints. This compromises the intended separation between the old and new collections

The absence of logic in the `sunsetCollection` function to delete or reset checkpoint data means that even though the collection is "shut down," its historical performance data remains, leading to issues.
## Impact
Users who create a new collection will be subjected to higher costs because the old checkpoint data may reflect a much higher compounded factor. This can make participating in Flayer unattractive as they will be demotivated to re-create the collection

```solidity
    function sunsetCollection(address _collection) public collectionExists(_collection) {
  // Ensure that only our {CollectionShutdown} contract can call this
  if (msg.sender != address(collectionShutdown)) revert InvalidCaller();

  // cache
  ICollectionToken collectionToken_ = _collectionToken[_collection];

  // Burn our held tokens to remove any contract bloat
  collectionToken_.burn(collectionToken_.balanceOf(address(this)));

  // Notify our stalkers that the collection has been sunset
  emit CollectionSunset(_collection, address(collectionToken_), msg.sender);

  // Delete our underlying token, then no deposits or actions can be made
  delete _collectionToken[_collection];

  // Remove our `collectionInitialized` flag
  delete collectionInitialized[_collection];
}

```

</details>

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider Deleting the CheckPoint inside the `sunsetCollection` when it is called
```diff
  // Delete our underlying token, then no deposits or actions can be made
  delete _collectionToken[_collection];

  // Remove our `collectionInitialized` flag
  delete collectionInitialized[_collection];

+ // Remove our Checkpoint data
+ delete IProtectedListings.collectionCheckpoints[_collection]
```
