# ERC20 Token Over-Minting in initializeCollection() of Locker contract

## Summary
The initializeCollection() function mints ERC20 tokens based on the number of NFTs deposited without checking the value or quality of the NFTs. This could allow an attacker to mint large quantities of ERC20 tokens by depositing low-value or fake NFTs.

## Vulnerability Detail
There are no checks in place to ensure that the NFTs being deposited are valuable or legitimate. The function mints ERC20 tokens based purely on the number of NFTs deposited, regardless of their actual value.

## Impact
Attackers could deposit low-value or fake NFTs and mint large amounts of ERC20 tokens, inflating the token supply.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a value-check mechanism to ensure that tokens are only minted for legitimate and valuable NFTs. You can also add a cap to limit the number of tokens minted per transaction. Example update code is as follows.
```solidity
uint maxMintLimit = 1000 * 1 ether;
require(tokens <= maxMintLimit, "Mint limit exceeded");
```
Additionally, implement a whitelist for approved NFT collections to ensure only legitimate NFTs are accepted.
