# Calling `depositTransaction()` on the optimism portal directly doesn't allow to replay transaction in case they fail

### Summary

_No response_

### Root Cause

To bridge assets from L1 to L2 using Moongate a user starts by calling [crossTheThreshold()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/moongate/src/InfernalRiftAbove.sol#L83)/[crossTheThreshold1155](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/moongate/src/InfernalRiftAbove.sol#L137), which calls [depositTransaction()](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/62c7f3b05a70027b30054d4c8974f44000606fb7/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/OptimismPortal.sol#L434) on the optimism portal directly. 

Using the optimism portal directly doesn't allow transactions [to be replayed](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/62c7f3b05a70027b30054d4c8974f44000606fb7/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/OptimismPortal.sol#L19C1-L21C96):
>  @notice The OptimismPortal is a low-level contract responsible for passing messages between L1 and L2. Messages sent directly to the OptimismPortal have no form of replayability. Users are encouraged to use the L1CrossDomainMessenger for a higher-level interface.

This means that if the L2 transactions fail, NFTs will be stuck on the L1 `InfernalRiftAbove` contract, as there is no way to replay the transaction and no tokens are minted by `InfernalRiftAbove`. The L2 transaction can when:
- The specified gas limit is not enough, leading to the L2 transaction failing for an out-of-gas error
- One of the passed `packages` structures has the `amounts` parameter set to an empty array, which will revert [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/moongate/src/InfernalRiftBelow.sol#L153)
- The royalty amount passed when a collection on L2 has not been deployed yet is bigger than `10000`, which would fail when collections are [initialized](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/moongate/src/libs/ERC721Bridgable.sol#L57) on the internal `_setDefaultRoyalty()` call.

### Attack Path

### Impact

ERC721/ERC1155 tokens bridged via Moongate can get stuck in the L1 `InfernalRiftAbove` contract if the L2 transaction to [InfernalRiftBelow::thresholdCross()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/moongate/src/InfernalRiftBelow.sol#L135) fails.

### Mitigation

Use the `L1CrossDomainMessenger` contract to bridge assets.
