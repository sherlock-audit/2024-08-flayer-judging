# User's listing can expire unexpectedly due to pause

## Summary
The `listing::getListingType` function is time-dependent and is used to determine the type of a specific listing within the protocol. Liquid listings expire after a specified period and transition into dutch listings. However, pause time can affect this process, as it is not considered in the calculation


## Vulnerability Detail
Medusa creates a liquid listing and expects it to expire in 150 days 
Medusa's listing has not been filled even on day 149 since her listing 
The protocol became paused some hours to the end of day 150 and still remain paused after day 150
medusa's listing has now expired is now a Dutch listing
Medusa can no longer modify her listing, or cancel her listing ðŸ˜­
Recon can now buy her listing as Dutch ðŸ’€

## Impact
User's listing gets expired not considering pause time 
## Code Snippet

There is an `if` statement below which prevents you from calling the `modifyListings` function if your listing has expired
```solidity
    function modifyListings(address _collection, ModifyListing[] calldata _modifyListings, bool _payTaxWithEscrow) public nonReentrant lockerNotPaused returns (uint taxRequired_, uint refund_) {
        uint fees;

        for (uint i; i < _modifyListings.length; ++i) {
            // Store the listing
            ModifyListing memory params = _modifyListings[i];
            Listing storage listing = _listings[_collection][params.tokenId];

            // We can only modify liquid listings
@>            if (getListingType(listing) != Enums.ListingType.LIQUID) revert InvalidListingType();
```
There is an `if` statement below which prevents you from calling the `cancelListings` function if your listing has expired
```solidity
    function cancelListings(address _collection, uint[] memory _tokenIds, bool _payTaxWithEscrow) public lockerNotPaused {
        uint fees;
        uint refund; 

        for (uint i; i < _tokenIds.length; ++i) {
            uint _tokenId = _tokenIds[i];

            // Read the listing in a single read
            Listing memory listing = _listings[_collection][_tokenId];

            // Ensure the caller is the owner of the listing
            if (listing.owner != msg.sender) revert CallerIsNotOwner(listing.owner);

            // We cannot allow a dutch listing to be cancelled. This will also check that a liquid listing has not
            // expired, as it will instantly change to a dutch listing type.
            Enums.ListingType listingType = getListingType(listing);
  @>          if (listingType != Enums.ListingType.LIQUID) revert CannotCancelListingType();
```
The code block here shows how listing types are determined 
```solidity
    function getListingType(Listing memory _listing) public view returns (Enums.ListingType) {
        // If we cannot find a valid listing and get a null parameter value, then we know
        // that the listing does not exist and it is therefore just a base token.
        if (_listing.owner == address(0)) {
            return Enums.ListingType.NONE;
        }

        // If the listing was created as a dutch listing, or if the liquid listing has
        // expired, then this is a dutch listing.
        if (
            (_listing.duration >= MIN_DUTCH_DURATION && _listing.duration <= MAX_DUTCH_DURATION) ||
@>            _listing.created + _listing.duration < block.timestamp 
        ) {
            return Enums.ListingType.DUTCH;
        }

        // For all other eventualities, we have a default liquid listing
        return Enums.ListingType.LIQUID; 
    
```
