# Ignored return values in critical functions leading to potential state inconsistencies

## Summary
In multiple instances across the `Listings.sol` and `ProtectedListings.sol` contracts, return values from critical function calls, such as `createCheckpoint` and `_createCheckpoint`, are ignored. This could potentially result in the system proceeding with operations despite failures in creating checkpoints or handling listings. Ignoring these return values may lead to inconsistencies in the contract's state or operational failures that go unnoticed.

## Vulnerability Detail
Several function calls within the contract return values, but the returned values are not being checked or handled properly. Specifically, calls to the functions `createCheckpoint`, `_mapListings`, and `_createCheckpoint` are made without verifying whether they were successful. These functions could potentially fail, and without checking their return values, the contract could behave incorrectly while assuming the operations succeeded.

## Impact
**State inconsistencies:** If a checkpoint fails to be created, the contract may continue operations with outdated or incorrect data, leading to potential failures in subsequent logic.
**Operational failures:** Undetected errors in handling listings or creating checkpoints may result in a breakdown of the contract’s functionality.
**Security vulnerabilities:** If the failure to create checkpoints is critical to the system's integrity, attackers might exploit this to manipulate the contract’s state.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add `requite` statement. For instance: 
```solidity
bool success = protectedListings.createCheckpoint(listing.collection);
require(success, "Checkpoint creation failed");

```
