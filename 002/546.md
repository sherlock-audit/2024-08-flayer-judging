# Locker refunds wrong amount upon collection initialization

### Summary

[Locker::initializeCollection](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L382-L398) employs the wrong logic for refunding of unused native token amount:

```solidity
// Send the native ETH equivalent token into the implementation
uint startBalance = nativeToken.balanceOf(address(this));
nativeToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(_implementation), _eth);

// Make our internal call to our implementation
uint tokens = _tokenIdsLength * 1 ether * 10 ** _collectionToken[_collection].denomination();
_implementation.initializeCollection(_collection, _eth, tokens, _tokenSlippage, _sqrtPriceX96);

// @audit ... unimportant parts

// Refund any unused relative token to the user
nativeToken.transfer(
    msg.sender,
    startBalance - nativeToken.balanceOf(address(this))
);
```

As can be seen:

1. the contract starting balance is captured in `startBalance`
2. `_eth` amount is transferred from the sender to the implementation
3. Collection is initialized in the implementation (which in turn interacts with the `PoolManager` to unlock the pool)
4. The refund in native token is sent to user as the diff `startBalance - endBalance`.

Notice that:

- For the last call not to revert, it should be `startBalance >= endBalance`, i.e. the native balance of the contract needs to stay the same or to decrease.
- If for any reason it has decreased by $\Delta$, the same $\Delta$ is refunded to the caller, i.e. the total decrease will be $2\Delta$.

### Root Cause

The logic of refund in [Locker::initializeCollection](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L394-L398) is wrong, and the opposite should be refunded instead, i.e. `nativeToken.balanceOf(address(this)) - startBalance`.

### Internal pre-conditions

- Some dust is left in the `Locker`'s balance of `nativeToken` ==> then the call will revert
- `Locker`'s balance of `nativeToken` decreases ==> the decrease will be wrongly refunded to the caller

### Impact

If internal preconditions are met, then either:
- the call will revert (rendering the protocol unusable);
- or the caller will receive the refund they have no right for, which is a direct loss of funds for the protocol.

### PoC

not required

### Mitigation

Revert the refunded amount:
