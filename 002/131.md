# `beforeInitialize` hook will always block the pool initialization

## Summary
Wrong implementation of the `beforeInitialize` will DOS the whole `UniswapImplementation.sol` contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
When a collection is registered in the `registerCollection` function the following parameters are passed in the poolKey struct:
```solidity
 // Create our Uniswap pool and store the pool key
        PoolKey memory poolKey = PoolKey({
            currency0: Currency.wrap(!currencyFlipped ? nativeToken : address(_collectionToken)),
            currency1: Currency.wrap(currencyFlipped ? nativeToken : address(_collectionToken)),
            fee: LPFeeLibrary.DYNAMIC_FEE_FLAG,
            tickSpacing: POOL_TICK_SPACING,
>>>            hooks: IHooks(address(this))
        });

        // Store our {PoolKey} mapping against the collection
        _poolKeys[_collection] = poolKey;
```
As pointed above the hooks contract will be this address.
However when we try to call `initializeCollection` an external call to the uniswapV4 poolManager is made:
```solidity
poolManager.initialize(poolKey, _sqrtPriceX96, '');
```
In this call the pool manager calls the `beforeInitialize` hook: 
https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-core/blob/18b223cab19dc778d9d287a82d29fee3e99162b0/src/PoolManager.sol#L132

However when we check out the beforeInitialize hook in the UniswapImplementation contract we see that the function will always revert here:

As a result the `initializeCollection` function will be unusable as will the whole `UniswapImplementation` contract be.

## Impact
DOS of the `UniswapImplementation.sol`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement the hook correctly so it does not revert
