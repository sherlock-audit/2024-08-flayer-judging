# Users can't withdraw funds and fees previously deposited for initializing Uniswap collection pool

### Summary

While initializing Uniswap collection pool, users need to provide some ````TokenIds```` and ETH as initial liquidity. These liquidity will be owned by the ````UniswapImplementation```` contract. The issue is that there is no interface for users to withdraw these liquidity later, and users loss these funds permanently.

### Root Cause

While initializing Uniswap collection pool, the full call-stack is as
```solidity
->Locker.initializeCollection()
-->UniswapImplementation.initializeCollection()
--->PoolManager.unlock()
---->UniswapImplementation._unlockCallback()
----->poolManager.modifyLiquidity()
```
The direct caller(````msg.sender````) of ````poolManager.modifyLiquidity()```` is the ````UniswapImplementation````. Per ````PoolManager.sol:164````([link](https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-core/blob/e06fb6a3511d61332db4a9fa05bc4348937c07d4/src/PoolManager.sol#L164)), the liqudity owner will be ````UniswapImplementation```` contract, not the user.
```solidity
File: lib\v4-core\src\PoolManager.sol
150:     function modifyLiquidity(
...
154:     ) external onlyWhenUnlocked noDelegateCall returns (BalanceDelta callerDelta, BalanceDelta feesAccrued) {
...
162:         (principalDelta, feesAccrued) = pool.modifyLiquidity(
163:             Pool.ModifyLiquidityParams({
164:                 owner: msg.sender,
...
170:             })
171:         );

```
Meanwhile, after checking all interfaces in ````UniswapImplementation````, we can find there is no implementation and interface for users to withdraw these liquidity.

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

users loss funds used for initializing Uniswap collection pools, and also loss LP fees earned by these liqudity.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation
(1) In ````UniswapImplementation```` contract, storing the related users as owners of initial liquidity
(2) When certain conditions are met, such as there is enough other liquidity in pools or the admin wants to close a pool, users can call interface such as ````withdrawInitialLiqudity()```` to get their funds and fees back.
