# Initializing a new collection will always revert

## Summary
Initializing a new collection will always revert because the hook beforeInitialize always revert.
## Vulnerability Detail
When initializing a new collection, the code will ask pool manager to initialize the pool corresponding for that collection.
```solidity
function initializeCollection(address _collection, uint _amount0, uint _amount1, uint _amount1Slippage, uint160 _sqrtPriceX96) public override {
...
poolManager.initialize(poolKey, _sqrtPriceX96, '');
...
}
```
Pool manager then will execute the request. During the execution, pool manager will call to the hook assigned with this init request:
```solidity
 function initialize(PoolKey memory key, uint160 sqrtPriceX96, bytes calldata hookData)
        external
        noDelegateCall
        returns (int24 tick)
    {
...
 key.hooks.beforeInitialize(key, sqrtPriceX96, hookData);
...
    }
```

The problem is that the beforeInitialize() hook  that pool manager is going to call to later will always revert.

```solidity
function beforeInitialize(address /* sender */, PoolKey memory /* key */, uint160 /* sqrtPriceX96 */, bytes calldata /* hookData */) public view override onlyByPoolManager returns (bytes4) {
        revert CannotBeInitializedDirectly();
    }
```
## Impact
DOS of core function

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove the revert in beforeInitialize()
