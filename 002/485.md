# `beforeInitialize` Hook is Misconfigured to Revert on All Calls, Despite Being Set to True

### Summary

The [beforeInitialize](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/UniswapImplementation.sol#L431) hook is incorrectly configured to always revert, despite being intended to allow initialization by the Uniswap pool manager



### Root Cause

In UniswapImplementation contract, the `beforeInitialize` hook is set to true, as seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/UniswapImplementation.sol#L431), this is meant to allow uniswap pool manager contract to call the implementation when initializing a new pool.  But currently, [UniswapImplementation::beforeInitialize](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/UniswapImplementation.sol#L452-L454) function always triggers a revert whenever called.
```solidity

    function beforeInitialize(
        address /* sender */,
        PoolKey memory /* key */,
        uint160 /* sqrtPriceX96 */,
        bytes calldata /* hookData */
    ) public view override onlyByPoolManager returns (bytes4) {
        revert CannotBeInitializedDirectly();      //<---@
    }

```
As seen above, it currently has the `onlyByPoolManager` modifier, which restricts all calls to only the pool manager, but yet still triggers the `CannotBeInitializedDirectly` error revert afterwards.

### Impact


initializing a collection via [UniswapImplementation::initializeCollection](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/UniswapImplementation.sol#L205-L240) will always result in a revert.

### Mitigation

turn [beforeInitialize](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/UniswapImplementation.sol#L431) to false or update beforeInitialize function by removing the revert and also returning the function selector.
