# User won't be refunded after initializing a collection

## Summary
User won't be refunded after initializing a collection.

## Vulnerability Detail
User can call [initializeCollection()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L367) to initialize a collection to set a base price and inject initial liquidity. The user is required to deposit ERC721 tokens and send native tokens.
[Locker.sol#L379-L384](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L379-L384):
```solidity
        // Convert the tokens into ERC20's which will return at a rate of 1:1
@>      deposit(_collection, _tokenIds, address(_implementation));

        // Send the native ETH equivalent token into the implementation
        uint startBalance = nativeToken.balanceOf(address(this));
@>      nativeToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(_implementation), _eth);
```
At the end of the initialization, user will be refunded with unused native tokens.
[Locker.sol#L394-L398](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L394-L398):
```solidity
        // Refund any unused relative token to the user
        nativeToken.transfer(
            msg.sender,
            startBalance - nativeToken.balanceOf(address(this))
        );
```
The problem is that the native tokens are transferred from user to Implementation contract directly before the initialization, however, after the pool is initialized, no unused native tokens are transferred back to Locker contract, this means user won't be able to receive any refunds.

## Impact

Locker contract is trusted by user to behave properly, so for the sake of convenience, user may send more native tokens than required to initialize a collection, and this is not user's fault. Due to this issue, there is no refund as promised and user will suffer a loss.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The unused native tokens should be sent back to Locker contract to refund user, the refund amount should be calculated as below:
[Locker.sol#L394-L398](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L394-L398):
```diff
        // Refund any unused relative token to the user
        nativeToken.transfer(
            msg.sender,
-           startBalance - nativeToken.balanceOf(address(this))
+           nativeToken.balanceOf(address(this)) - startBalance
        );
```
