# User extra funds during Pool initializtion would be stuck in `UniswapImplementation`

### Summary

Locker contract interact with extra native tokens sent from user during pool initialisation in the wrong way leading to lost funds to user 

### Root Cause

balance accounting of locker contract instead of implementation contract leading to funds loss to user

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

User needs to calculate needed `nativeToken` using `_sqrtPriceX96` and amount `collectionToken` wrongly

Loss of funds depends on how much the pool won't take during initialization and will be stuck in the implementation (The extra sent funds)

### Attack Path

When user calls `Locker::initializeCollection()` with predetermined `_eth`  

they get sent directly to `_implementation` [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L384) 

but as we see in `Locker::initializeCollection()` 

```solidity
File: Locker.sol
367:     function initializeCollection(address _collection, uint _eth, uint[] calldata _tokenIds, uint _tokenSlippage, uint160 _sqrtPriceX96) public virtual whenNotPaused collectionExists(_collection) {
//////////////////////
378: 
379:         // Convert the tokens into ERC20's which will return at a rate of 1:1
380:         deposit(_collection, _tokenIds, address(_implementation));
381: 
382:         // Send the native ETH equivalent token into the implementation
383:         uint startBalance = nativeToken.balanceOf(address(this));//@audit it index the locker balance instead of implementation 
384:         nativeToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(_implementation), _eth);
385: 
386:         // Make our internal call to our implementation
387:         uint tokens = _tokenIdsLength * 1 ether * 10 ** _collectionToken[_collection].denomination();
388:         _implementation.initializeCollection(_collection, _eth, tokens, _tokenSlippage, _sqrtPriceX96);
389: 
390:         // Map our collection as initialized
391:         collectionInitialized[_collection] = true;
392:         emit CollectionInitialized(_collection, _implementation.getCollectionPoolKey(_collection), _tokenIds, _sqrtPriceX96, msg.sender);
393: 
394:         // Refund any unused relative token to the user
395:         nativeToken.transfer( //@audit this integration tries to send extraBalance sent from users back to him but it failes cause extraBalance is in UniswapImplementation.sol
396:             msg.sender,
397:             startBalance - nativeToken.balanceOf(address(this)) //@audit this substraction will always be 0 since this address balance never changed
398:         );
399:     }
```

Now here are the steps where the bug would arrise
1. User call `initializeCollection` with 20e18 `wETH` and 10NFT that its collection token has 0 `denomination` (10e18 `collectionToken`)  `_sqrtPriceX96` of (for example 1 `Ratio`)
2. 20e18 `wETH` and 10e18 `collectionToken` is sent to `implementation` 
3. in Line 388 `_implementation.initializeCollection` called that initialize the pool through `poolManager.initialize` and retrieves the needed liquidity [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/UniswapImplementation.sol#L382) and deposit them [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/UniswapImplementation.sol#L394-L401) 
4. Now since the `_sqrtPriceX96` is of 1 Ratio then the tokens pushed [here]((https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/UniswapImplementation.sol#L394-L401) will be 10e18 of both tokens, any extra tokens won't be pushed (meaning they stay in the contract)

What would have been the right implementation is checking for `balanceOf(_implementation)` to make sure that all tokens user has deposited have gone into the pool and if not we do The line 396 Logic to pull extra tokens  from `_implementation` (approvals will be needed for Locker contract)

>**_Note!:_**Those extra Tokens stuck at `_Implemenation` can be utilized by attacker providing less `_eth` than calculated intentionally during his pool initialization so that the user's stuck funds pay those needed `_eth` 

### Impact

Loss of funds to user

wrong balance accounting of extra funds by Locker contract that if were don't right, the issue would have appeared 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```diff
    function initializeCollection(address _collection, uint _eth, uint[] calldata _tokenIds, uint _tokenSlippage, uint160 _sqrtPriceX96) public virtual whenNotPaused collectionExists(_collection) {
        // Ensure the collection is not already initialised
        if (collectionInitialized[_collection]) revert CollectionAlreadyInitialized();

        // Ensure that the minimum threshold of collection tokens have been provided
        uint _tokenIdsLength = _tokenIds.length;
        if (_tokenIdsLength < MINIMUM_TOKEN_IDS) revert InsufficientTokenIds();

        // cache
        IBaseImplementation _implementation = implementation;
        IERC20 nativeToken = IERC20(_implementation.nativeToken());

        // Convert the tokens into ERC20's which will return at a rate of 1:1
        deposit(_collection, _tokenIds, address(_implementation));

        // Send the native ETH equivalent token into the implementation
 -      uint startBalance = nativeToken.balanceOf(address(this));
+      uint startBalance = nativeToken.balanceOf(address(_implementation ));
        nativeToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(_implementation), _eth);

        // Make our internal call to our implementation
        uint tokens = _tokenIdsLength * 1 ether * 10 ** _collectionToken[_collection].denomination();
        _implementation.initializeCollection(_collection, _eth, tokens, _tokenSlippage, _sqrtPriceX96);

        // Map our collection as initialized
        collectionInitialized[_collection] = true;
        emit CollectionInitialized(_collection, _implementation.getCollectionPoolKey(_collection), _tokenIds, _sqrtPriceX96, msg.sender);

        // Refund any unused relative token to the user
-        nativeToken.transfer(
-            msg.sender,
-            startBalance - nativeToken.balanceOf(address(this))
+      nativeToken.transferFrom(_implementation, 
+      msg.sender, 
+      startBalance - nativeToken.balanceOf(address(_implementation))
        );
    }
