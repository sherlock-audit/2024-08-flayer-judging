# `initializeCollection(...)` is prone to revert

### Summary

The `initializeCollection(...)` function may be DOS if the caller is a contract or a multisig wallet

### Root Cause

The problem is that the [`initializeCollection(...)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L395-L398) function attempts to return excess ETH with the use of solidity's `transfer(...)` function, but this will be a problem because only 2300 gas is sent with the function but 
- multisig wallet could use up to 6000 gas, 
- contracts could implement extra logic in their receive function which will require more than 2300 gas leading to a revert due to insuffucient gas

```solidity
File: Locker.sol
367:     function initializeCollection(address _collection, uint _eth, uint[] calldata _tokenIds, uint _tokenSlippage, uint160 _sqrtPriceX96) public virtual whenNotPaused collectionExists(_collection) {
368:         // Ensure the collection is not already initialised
369:         if (collectionInitialized[_collection]) revert CollectionAlreadyInitialized();

SNIP           ..............
393: 
394:         // Refund any unused relative token to the user
395:    @>     nativeToken.transfer( // @audit 22) will revert for some wallets due to insufficient gas
396:             msg.sender,
397:             startBalance - nativeToken.balanceOf(address(this))
398:         );
399:     }

```

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

This can lead to a DOS in the `initializeCollection(...)` function.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider using `call(...)` in all instances where `transfer(...)` is used to send ETH.
