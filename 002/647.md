# Any user calling the `Locker::initializeCollection` function will loose both their ERC721 tokens and the ETH (WETH) they provide.

### Summary

The `Locker::initializeCollection` function is designed to facilitate the creation of initial liquidity for an NFT collection. It enables users to deposit at least 10 NFT tokens along with an equivalent amount of ETH (WETH), based on the current market price of the assets. This function then establishes a Uniswap V4 pool using ERC20 tokens minted from the deposited NFTs and the provided ETH, thereby creating the pool's liquidity.

However, the current implementation has a critical flaw: users who provide initial liquidity do not receive LP tokens or any other form of compensation to represent their share of the liquidity. Furthermore, there is no internal accounting to track who initiated the liquidity provision, which would otherwise allow them to claim a proportional share of the pool.

The issue becomes apparent in the following sections of the `Locker::initializeCollection` function:

- **[Line 380](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L380):** ERC721 tokens are deposited into the `Locker` contract, and the equivalent ERC20 tokens are minted and sent to the `Implementation` contract.

- **[Line 384](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L384):** WETH is transferred from the userâ€™s account to the `Implementation` contract.

- **[Line 388](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L388):** The `UniswapImplementation::initializeCollection` function is called to create the Uniswap V4 pool using the ERC20 tokens and WETH. However, none of the parameters passed to this function include information about the original caller, resulting in a lack of linkage between the liquidity pool and the initial contributor.

Additionally, the `msg.sender` is always set to `address(locker)` in the three aforementioned calls, making it impossible for the `Implementation` contract to associate the liquidity with the original caller.

```solidity
    function initializeCollection(address _collection, uint _eth, uint[] calldata _tokenIds, uint _tokenSlippage, uint160 _sqrtPriceX96) public virtual whenNotPaused collectionExists(_collection) {
        // Ensure the collection is not already initialised
        if (collectionInitialized[_collection]) revert CollectionAlreadyInitialized();

        // Ensure that the minimum threshold of collection tokens have been provided
        uint _tokenIdsLength = _tokenIds.length;
        if (_tokenIdsLength < MINIMUM_TOKEN_IDS) revert InsufficientTokenIds();

        // cache
        IBaseImplementation _implementation = implementation;
        IERC20 nativeToken = IERC20(_implementation.nativeToken());

        // Convert the tokens into ERC20's which will return at a rate of 1:1
        deposit(_collection, _tokenIds, address(_implementation)); // @> L380

        // Send the native ETH equivalent token into the implementation
        uint startBalance = nativeToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        nativeToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(_implementation), _eth); // @> L384

        // Make our internal call to our implementation
        uint tokens = _tokenIdsLength * 1 ether * 10 ** _collectionToken[_collection].denomination();
        _implementation.initializeCollection(_collection, _eth, tokens, _tokenSlippage, _sqrtPriceX96); // @> L388

        // Map our collection as initialized
        collectionInitialized[_collection] = true;
        emit CollectionInitialized(_collection, _implementation.getCollectionPoolKey(_collection), _tokenIds, _sqrtPriceX96, msg.sender);

// @> There is no record of who initiated the liquidity provision

        // Refund any unused relative token to the user
        nativeToken.transfer(
            msg.sender,
            startBalance - nativeToken.balanceOf(address(this))
        );
    }
```

### Root Cause

There is no internal accounting to track who initiated the liquidity provision, which would otherwise provide proof of their contribution and entitle them to a proportional share of the pool.

### Impact

Users calling the `Locker::initializeCollection` function will loose both their ERC721 tokens and the ETH (WETH) they provide.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement an accounting system to enable users who provide initial liquidity to either withdraw their contributions or recover their liquidity if the collection is shut down. This system should track user contributions and ensure that liquidity stored in the Uniswap V4 pool can be reclaimed as needed.
