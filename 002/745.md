# The initializeCollection function cannot be used due to incorrect implementation logic

## Summary
The initializeCollection function cannot be used due to incorrect implementation logic.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the logic of the initializeCollection function, the used token will be returned.
```solidity
        nativeToken.transfer(
            msg.sender,
            startBalance - nativeToken.balanceOf(address(this))
        );
```
However, there is a problem with the calculation logic. The function uses the logic of startBalance - nativeToken.balanceOf(address(this)). It is wrong to subtract the balance at the end from the balance at the beginning. This may result in a negative number and cause the transaction to be rolled back.
## Impact
The initializeCollection function cannot be used.

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Locker.sol
```solidity
397L  -   startBalance - nativeToken.balanceOf(address(this));
397L  +  nativeToken.balanceOf(address(this)) - startBalance;
```
