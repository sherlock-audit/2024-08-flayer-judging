# Collection pool initialization can be DoSed

## Summary
Collection pool initialization can be DoSed.

## Vulnerability Detail
To initialize a collection pool, [initializeCollection()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/UniswapImplementation.sol#L205) in UniswapImplementation contract will be called, then Uniswap V4 PoolManager is called:
[UniswapImplementation.sol#L213-L214](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/UniswapImplementation.sol#L213-L214):
```solidity
        // Initialise our pool
        poolManager.initialize(poolKey, _sqrtPriceX96, '');
```
The problem is that a malicious user can call PoolManager's [initialize()](https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-core/blob/18b223cab19dc778d9d287a82d29fee3e99162b0/src/PoolManager.sol#L115-L118) directly and create the pool with the same poolKey right after a collection was registered but before it is initialized (not front-run), as a result, our collection pool initialization will eventually revert due to that the pool has already been initialized.
[PoolManager.sol#L137](https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-core/blob/18b223cab19dc778d9d287a82d29fee3e99162b0/src/PoolManager.sol#L137):
```solidity
        tick = _pools[id].initialize(sqrtPriceX96, protocolFee, lpFee);
```
[Pool.sol#L101](https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-core/blob/18b223cab19dc778d9d287a82d29fee3e99162b0/src/libraries/Pool.sol#L101):
```solidity
        if (self.slot0.sqrtPriceX96() != 0) PoolAlreadyInitialized.selector.revertWith();
```

## Impact
Collection pool initialization is DoSed.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

If the collection has already been initialized, the transaction doesn't have to revert, the only thing to worry about is `sqrtPriceX96`.
[UniswapImplementation.sol#L213-L214](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/UniswapImplementation.sol#L213-L214):
```diff
        // Initialise our pool
+       try
                poolManager.initialize(poolKey, _sqrtPriceX96, '') {}
+       catch {
+              // all we need to do is to adjust the price by swapping
+       }
```
