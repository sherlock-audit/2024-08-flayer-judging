# A calculation error in the Locker::initializeCollection() function could cause a Denial of Service (DoS).


## Summary
The minuend and subtrahend were written in reverse during the calculation, causing a Denial of Service (DoS).
## Vulnerability Detail
```javascript
function initializeCollection(address _collection, uint _eth, uint[] calldata _tokenIds, uint _tokenSlippage, uint160 _sqrtPriceX96) public virtual whenNotPaused collectionExists(_collection) {
        // Ensure the collection is not already initialised
        if (collectionInitialized[_collection]) revert CollectionAlreadyInitialized();

        // Ensure that the minimum threshold of collection tokens have been provided
        uint _tokenIdsLength = _tokenIds.length;
        if (_tokenIdsLength < MINIMUM_TOKEN_IDS) revert InsufficientTokenIds();

        // cache
        IBaseImplementation _implementation = implementation;
        IERC20 nativeToken = IERC20(_implementation.nativeToken());

        // Convert the tokens into ERC20's which will return at a rate of 1:1
        deposit(_collection, _tokenIds, address(_implementation));

        // Send the native ETH equivalent token into the implementation
@>>        uint startBalance = nativeToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        nativeToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(_implementation), _eth);

        // Make our internal call to our implementation
        uint tokens = _tokenIdsLength * 1 ether * 10 ** _collectionToken[_collection].denomination();
@>>        _implementation.initializeCollection(_collection, _eth, tokens, _tokenSlippage, _sqrtPriceX96);

        // Map our collection as initialized
        collectionInitialized[_collection] = true;
        emit CollectionInitialized(_collection, _implementation.getCollectionPoolKey(_collection), _tokenIds, _sqrtPriceX96, msg.sender);

        // Refund any unused relative token to the user
        nativeToken.transfer(
            msg.sender,
@>>            startBalance - nativeToken.balanceOf(address(this))
        );
    }

```
startBalance is the amount the user had before transferring native tokens to the _implementation contract. After executing the _implementation.initializeCollection() operation, a portion of _eth may be refunded, which could result in afterBalance = nativeToken.balanceOf(address(this)) being greater than startBalance.

Therefore, if startBalance < nativeToken.balanceOf(address(this)), due to Solidity 8â€™s characteristics, the expression startBalance - nativeToken.balanceOf(address(this)) will revert, causing the entire operation to fail, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).
## Impact
Due to the condition being written in reverse, the entire operation will fail, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).

## Recommendation
```diff
nativeToken.transfer(
            msg.sender,
-            startBalance - nativeToken.balanceOf(address(this))
+            nativeToken.balanceOf(address(this)) - startBalance  
        );
```
