# Incorrect refund logic for pool initialization

### Summary

The incorrect operation results in flawed refund logic implementation in [Locker.sol:397](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L397).

### Root Cause

In  [Locker.sol:397](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L397), we have a calculation for the amount of tokens that need to be refunded to the user. However, the problem is that it's done in reverse order. To calculate the remaining funds, we need to subtract the current balance from the starting balance, not the other way around.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Implementation returns excess tokens back to Locker contract

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. The user calls `initializeCollection` with an excess `_eth` value.

### Impact

The user won't be able to initialize a collection without providing the exact amount of _eth as input.

### PoC

1. Alice calls `initializeCollection` with `_eth` value of 20e18 and `startBalance` set to 0, as no collections were initialized before.
2. The new implementation has logic to return excess tokens back to the Locker contract, so it returns 5e18 tokens.
3. The Locker's current balance is now 5e18, and because the expression `0 - 5e18` will revert, the user won't be able to initialize the collection.

### Mitigation

Update code like that:
```diff
+    uint currentBalance =  nativeToken.balanceOf(address(this));
     nativeToken.transfer(
            msg.sender,
-        startBalance - nativeToken.balanceOf(address(this))
+        currentBalance > startBalance ?  currentBalance -  startBalance : startBalance - currentBalance
        );
```
