# First liquidity providers lose all of their assets

### Summary

_No response_

### Root Cause

Users providing liquidity to a new UniV4 pool via [Locker::initializeCollection()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L367) have no way of getting their assets (native token and collection tokens) back. The owner of the liquidity will be the `UniswapImplementation` contract which has no way of retrieving it.

### Attack Path

1. Alice initializes a new collection via [Locker::initializeCollection()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L367), she provides 10 NFTs and `NATIVE` tokens. This triggers a series of calls that transfer collection tokens and native tokens to the `UniswapImplementation` contract, which then provides the first liquidity the UniwapV4 pool via [UniswapImplementation:modifyLiquidity()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/UniswapImplementation.sol#L382).
2. UniswapV4 sets the owenership of the provided liquidity to the `msg.sender`, in this case the `UniswapImplementation` contract
3. The `UniswapImplementation` contract has no functionality that allows Alice to get her native tokens and collection tokens back from the liquidity pool

### Impact

The user initializing a collection via [Locker::initializeCollection()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L367) loses all of the assets: his NFTs are locked in `Locker` contract and his collection and native tokens are locked in the UniswapV4 pool.
