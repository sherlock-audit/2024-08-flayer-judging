# Missed extra ETH refund in the UniswapImplementation during the initialization of a collection.

## Summary
When a new collection is initialized in the Locker contract, it initializes the collection in UniswapImplementation and creates a full-range liquidity position. Any excess ETH from the transaction, based on sqrtPrice and token count, should be refunded via UniswapImplementation to the Locker contract and then to the user. However, the refund is missing, leading to stuck and lost funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
To initialize a new collection, the Locker contract's initializeCollection function is called, sending NFTs and the native token (equivalent to ETH) to the UniswapImplementation contract. UniswapImplementation is expected to create the first liquidity position and return any excess ETH to Locker, which then refunds the user.

```solidity
function initializeCollection(address _collection, uint _eth, uint[] calldata _tokenIds, uint _tokenSlippage, uint160 _sqrtPriceX96) public virtual whenNotPaused collectionExists(_collection) {
    /* fn implementation       */

    // Send the native ETH equivalent token into the implementation
    nativeToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(_implementation), _eth);

    // Refund any unused relative token to the user
    nativeToken.transfer(
        msg.sender,
        startBalance - nativeToken.balanceOf(address(this))
    );
}
```

## Impact
User funds getting stuck and lost.
