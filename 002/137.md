# Missing `beforeModifyLiquidity` and `afterModifyLiquidity` will cause  `poolManager.unlock` to revert

## Summary
Because of the missing implementation of beforeModifyLiquidity in `UniswapImplementation.sol` the initializeCollection will always revert.
## Vulnerability Detail
When a collection is being initialized via `initializeCollection` in `UniswapImplementation.sol` the following external call is made:

However when we check the function in the uniswapv4 pool manager we see that the following callback is being made:
https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-core/blob/e06fb6a3511d61332db4a9fa05bc4348937c07d4/src/PoolManager.sol#L159
However since out `UniswapImplementation.sol` is missing this hook the function will always revert.
The same is applicable for the `afterModifyLiquidity` function which is called here:

## Impact
DOS of the initializeCollection function
