# Users initializing Pools can steal Fees staying in `UniswapImplementation`

### Summary

Fees in `UniswapImplementation` owned to collection Pools or `ammBenefeciary` will be stolen by attacker initialising his collection Pool

### Root Cause

nativeToken (fees) of pools and `ammBenefeciary` is staying in `UniswapImplementation` till claimed or distributed

Till then, they are prone to be stolen by attacker through `Locker::initializeCollection()`

### Internal pre-conditions

Amount of lost funds depends on

1. nativeToken (fees) owned to Collection pools that are not distributed yet
2. ammBeneficiary fees are not claimed yet (or if the beneficiary is a pool then its not distributed yet)
3. Extra Funds sent by mistake when previous users initialized Pools with more than needed `_eth` not returned to them(mentioned in detail in another report how it happened)

### External pre-conditions

Attacker initializing a collectionPool through `Locker::initializeCollection()`

### Attack Path

**_Note!_** The following mentioned values are for reference, they are inflated for clarity reasons and the attack is feasible with what ever the value of fees staying in `UniswapImplementation`
1. `UniswapImplementation` has 1e18 wETH fees accumulated for multiple pools that has its `donateThreshold` at relative high value 
2. Attacker `Locker::initializeCollection()` with (10NFTs that transfer 10e18 to  `UniswapImplementation` ) with `_eth` as 9e18 and `_sqrtPriceX96` of (for example of 1 `ratio`) so that every 1 collection token worth 1 wETH
3. When liquidity needed `delta` is calculated [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/UniswapImplementation.sol#L382-L391) it will have `amount0` and `amount1` to be both 10e18
4. Those tokens will be pushed to the pool [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/UniswapImplementation.sol#L394-L396) and [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/UniswapImplementation.sol#L399-L401)  10e18 of both tokens
5. now the attacker was able to deposit 10e18 each of both tokens and only paying 9e18 wETH and 10e18 collectionToken (stealing 1e18 from fees in the contract)

### Impact

Loss of funds (fees) to `ammBenefeciary` and collection UniV4 collection Pools

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Try to compute the needed liquidity in `Locker:initializeCollection` and force taking it

or check balance of `UniswapImplementation` during the call to make sure it never decreased from the starting balance
