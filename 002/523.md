# Incorrect Refund Calculation in initializeCollection Function

## Summary

The function `Locker::initializeCollection` calculates the refund for excess tokens by subtracting the final balance of the contract from its starting balance using `startBalance - nativeToken.balanceOf(address(this))`. This approach is incorrect because the contract’s starting balance should not change, and any increase in balance should be refunded to the user. The current logic risks underflow if excess tokens remain after the liquidity addition, causing the transaction to fail and preventing collection initialization.

## Vulnerability Detail

The issue is in the refund logic within Locker::initializeCollection. The refund calculation currently uses:
 `startBalance - nativeToken.balanceOf(address(this))`. 

This logic incorrectly assumes that the contract’s starting balance should decrease, which is not the case. The contract's starting balance should remain unchanged, and any increase (representing excess tokens sent by the user) should be refunded. If there is an excess amount, the current logic leads to underflow, causing a transaction revert. This prevents successful initialization of the collection.

```solidity 

        // Send the native ETH equivalent token into the implementation
        uint startBalance = nativeToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        nativeToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(_implementation), _eth);

...
        // Refund any unused relative token to the user
        nativeToken.transfer(
            msg.sender,
            startBalance - nativeToken.balanceOf(address(this))
        );
```

## Impact

The incorrect refund logic will cause the transaction to revert if any excess native tokens are left , preventing the initialization of the collection

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Update the refund logic to correctly calculate the excess tokens that need to be refunded

```solidity
nativeToken.transfer(
    msg.sender,
-    startBalance - nativeToken.balanceOf(address(this))
+    nativeToken.balanceOf(address(this)) - startBalance

);
```
