# Incorrect refund logic leads to collection not being initialized.

## Summary
The initializeCollection function can revert in cases where excess ETH is refunded by the UniswapImplementation contract, preventing the collection from being initialized.

## Vulnerability Detail
When the UniswapImplementation contract refunds excess ETH-equivalent tokens, the current refund logic in the `initializeCollection` function uses startBalance - nativeToken.balanceOf(address(this)). This will always revert since the latest nativeToken balance after refund will be greater than the startBalance, which leads to negative value for the transfer.

```solidity
function initializeCollection(address _collection, uint _eth, uint[] calldata _tokenIds, uint _tokenSlippage, uint160 _sqrtPriceX96) public virtual whenNotPaused collectionExists(_collection) {
    /* fn implementation       */

    // Refund any unused relative token to the user
    nativeToken.transfer(
        msg.sender,
        startBalance - nativeToken.balanceOf(address(this))
    );
}
```

## Impact
If excess ETH is refunded, the entire transaction will revert, preventing the collection from being initialized.

## Recommendation
Update the nativeToken transfer line to ensure correct handling of excess ETH
```solidity
nativeToken.transfer(
    msg.sender,
    nativeToken.balanceOf(address(this) - startBalance)
);
```
