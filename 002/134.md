# `afterInitialize` will cause initializeCollection in `UniswapImplementation.sol` to always revert

## Summary
Missing implementation of the `afterInitialize` will DOS the whole `UniswapImplementation.sol` contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
When a collection is registered in the registerCollection function the following parameters are passed in the poolKey struct:
```solidity
 // Create our Uniswap pool and store the pool key
        PoolKey memory poolKey = PoolKey({
            currency0: Currency.wrap(!currencyFlipped ? nativeToken : address(_collectionToken)),
            currency1: Currency.wrap(currencyFlipped ? nativeToken : address(_collectionToken)),
            fee: LPFeeLibrary.DYNAMIC_FEE_FLAG,
            tickSpacing: POOL_TICK_SPACING,
>>>            hooks: IHooks(address(this))
        });

        // Store our {PoolKey} mapping against the collection
        _poolKeys[_collection] = poolKey;
```
As pointed above the hooks contract will be this address.
However when we try to call initializeCollection an external call to the uniswapV4 poolManager is made:
```solidity 
poolManager.initialize(poolKey, _sqrtPriceX96, '');
```
In this call the pool manager calls the afterInitialize hook:

However the hook will cause the function to always revert because of the missing override of the following function:

## Impact
