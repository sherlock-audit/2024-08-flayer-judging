# User Initializing a Pool will have his funds stuck

### Summary

User calling `Locker::initializeCollection()` Will have his liquidity Stuck and can't withdraw them back, leading to loss of funds

### Root Cause

Initialized liquidity are owned to `UniswapImplementation` and not The user initializing the pool, leading to stuck funds since neither him or the Admin can withdraw them back

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

Before the sequence of the bug, Firstly Users needs to call `Locker::createCollection()`  
That calls `UniswapImplementation::registerCollection()` 

Now the bug is as follows

User calls `Locker::initializeCollection()` to activate the uniV4 Pool and trading
```solidity
File: Locker.sol
367:     function initializeCollection(address _collection, uint _eth, uint[] calldata _tokenIds, uint _tokenSlippage, uint160 _sqrtPriceX96) public virtual whenNotPaused collectionExists(_collection) {
368:         // Ensure the collection is not already initialised
369:         if (collectionInitialized[_collection]) revert CollectionAlreadyInitialized();
370: 
371:         // Ensure that the minimum threshold of collection tokens have been provided
372:         uint _tokenIdsLength = _tokenIds.length;
373:         if (_tokenIdsLength < MINIMUM_TOKEN_IDS) revert InsufficientTokenIds();
374: 
375:         // cache
376:         IBaseImplementation _implementation = implementation;
377:         IERC20 nativeToken = IERC20(_implementation.nativeToken());
378: 
379:         // Convert the tokens into ERC20's which will return at a rate of 1:1
380:         deposit(_collection, _tokenIds, address(_implementation));
381: 
382:         // Send the native ETH equivalent token into the implementation
383:         uint startBalance = nativeToken.balanceOf(address(this));
384:         nativeToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(_implementation), _eth);
385: 
386:         // Make our internal call to our implementation
387:         uint tokens = _tokenIdsLength * 1 ether * 10 ** _collectionToken[_collection].denomination();
388:         _implementation.initializeCollection(_collection, _eth, tokens, _tokenSlippage, _sqrtPriceX96);
389: 
390:         // Map our collection as initialized
391:         collectionInitialized[_collection] = true;
392:         emit CollectionInitialized(_collection, _implementation.getCollectionPoolKey(_collection), _tokenIds, _sqrtPriceX96, msg.sender);
393: 
394:         // Refund any unused relative token to the user
395:         nativeToken.transfer(
396:             msg.sender,
397:             startBalance - nativeToken.balanceOf(address(this))
398:         );
399:     }
```

The user need to deposit at least 10NFT to initialize the collection

In Line 380 Those tokens gets deposited with `UniswapImplementation` as the receiver of minted `collectionToken`

in Line 384 we transfer the nativeToken (ie.wETH) to `UniswapImplementation` 

Now Both `CollectionToken` and `wETH` are in `UniswapImplementation` so that we are ready for the initialization in Line 388

The problem is that we we initialize the pool through `UniswapImplementation` calling `poolManager` is that the liquidity is now owned to `UniswapImplementation` and not the user

[Here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/UniswapImplementation.sol#L214)  `UniswapImplementation::initializeCollection()` calls Pool manager

Then it obtains a lock [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/UniswapImplementation.sol#L226-L239) with the specified liquidity params 

This is uniV4 `poolManager`  `unlock` function
```solidity
File: PoolManager.sol
105:     function unlock(bytes calldata data) external override returns (bytes memory result) {
106:         if (Lock.isUnlocked()) AlreadyUnlocked.selector.revertWith();
107: 
108:         Lock.unlock();
109: 
110:         // the caller does everything in this callback, including paying what they owe via calls to settle
111:         result = IUnlockCallback(msg.sender).unlockCallback(data); //@audit this calls our unlockCallback
112: 
113:         if (NonzeroDeltaCount.read() != 0) CurrencyNotSettled.selector.revertWith();
114:         Lock.lock();
115:     }
```

`unlockCallback` of `UniswapImplementation` will call `_unlockCallback` that call `poolManager::modifyLiquidity()` [Here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/UniswapImplementation.sol#L382-L391) 

Now the problem is that the owner of the liquidity pushed will be `msg.sender` which is `UniswapImplementation` as seen here
```solidity
File: PoolManager.sol
150:     function modifyLiquidity(
151:         PoolKey memory key,
152:         IPoolManager.ModifyLiquidityParams memory params,
153:         bytes calldata hookData
154:     ) external onlyWhenUnlocked noDelegateCall returns (BalanceDelta callerDelta, BalanceDelta feesAccrued) {
155:         PoolId id = key.toId();
156:         Pool.State storage pool = _getPool(id);
157:         pool.checkPoolInitialized();
158: 
159:         key.hooks.beforeModifyLiquidity(key, params, hookData);
160: 
161:         BalanceDelta principalDelta;
162:         (principalDelta, feesAccrued) = pool.modifyLiquidity(
163:             Pool.ModifyLiquidityParams({
164:                 owner: msg.sender,
165:                 tickLower: params.tickLower,
166:                 tickUpper: params.tickUpper,
167:                 liquidityDelta: params.liquidityDelta.toInt128(),
168:                 tickSpacing: key.tickSpacing,
169:                 salt: params.salt
170:             })
171:         );
```

This way, user initializing the pool with liquidity can't withdraw them back neither the owner since there are no function in `UniswapImplementation` to do so

This will lead to inability to shutdown any collection too, since total supply of `collectionToken` has to be < 5

### Impact

Loss of liquidity associated with pool initialization

As a minor impact, not being able to shutdown dormant collections as long as it has a liquidity pool initialized
