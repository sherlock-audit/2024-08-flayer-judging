# Protocol will give much more money as fee to beneficiary than expected

## Summary
Protocol will give much more money as fee to beneficiary than expected because of an incorrect calculation
## Vulnerability Detail
Fees in uniswap pools are represented in bips. 1000 pips = 0.1%. so 100% will be 1000*1000 = 1e6.
As in ProtocolFeeLibrary:
```solidity
   /// @notice Max protocol fee is 0.1% (1000 pips)
    /// @dev Increasing these values could lead to overflow in Pool.swap
    uint16 public constant MAX_PROTOCOL_FEE = 1000;

/// @notice the protocol fee is represented in hundredths of a bip
    uint256 internal constant PIPS_DENOMINATOR = 1_000_000;

```
However, in afterswap(), fee denominator is incorrectly represented as 1e5.
```solidity
  uint feeAmount = uint128(swapAmount) * ammFee / 100_000;
```
 As a result, final fee amount sent to beneficiary will be 10 times bigger than expected.
## Impact
Loss of funds for protocol.
