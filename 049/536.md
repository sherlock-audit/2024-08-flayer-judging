# Cannot cancel a dutch auction unlike intended

## Summary

From the whitepaper https://www.flayer.io/whitepaper it states:

> 2.3 Dutch Auction
> Users pre-pay interest for a specified number of days until their listing expires and are free to update the price or duration at the current fixed interest rate at any time. Listings can be closed at any time by the holder, returning any remaining pre-paid balance.
> 

"Listings can be closed at any time by the holder" 

However, the code contradicts this. there, it contains the following logic:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L427-L430

```solidity
    // We cannot allow a dutch listing to be cancelled. This will also check that a liquid listing has not
    // expired, as it will instantly change to a dutch listing type.
    Enums.ListingType listingType = getListingType(listing);

    if (listingType != Enums.ListingType.LIQUID) revert CannotCancelListingType();
```

This prevents the cancellation of Dutch auctions, allowing only liquid auctions to be canceled. Therefore, the description suggesting that Dutch listings can be freely closed is inaccurate based on the current implementation.

## Impact
lister could lose funds, particularly due to the following reasons:

- Pre-paid Interest: In a Dutch auction, users pre-pay interest for the duration of the listing. If the listing cannot be canceled, the user cannot reclaim any remaining pre-paid interest. This means that if the asset does not sell, the pre-paid interest is effectively lost, even though the user no longer benefits from the auction being active.

- Market Conditions: If the market changes or the user no longer wants to sell the asset at the current price, they are stuck with the listing. They would have no way to delist the asset and might be forced to sell at a lower price than desired or leave the listing to expire, losing the funds paid upfront for interest.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    // We cannot allow a dutch listing to be cancelled. This will also check that a liquid listing has not
    // expired, as it will instantly change to a dutch listing type.
    Enums.ListingType listingType = getListingType(listing);

    if (listingType != Enums.ListingType.LIQUID) revert CannotCancelListingType();
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The code should allow Dutch listings to be canceled. Modify the cancellation logic to permit cancellations of Dutch listings:

If only Allow Dutch Listings to be Canceled

```solidity
function cancelListings(address _collection, uint[] memory _tokenIds, bool _payTaxWithEscrow) public lockerNotPaused {
    -- SNIP -- 
    - if (listingType != Enums.ListingType.LIQUID) revert CannotCancelListingType();
    + if (listingType != Enums.ListingType.DUTCH) revert CannotCancelListingType();
}
```

If Both Dutch and Liquid Listings are allowed to be Canceled
```solidity
function cancelListings(address _collection, uint[] memory _tokenIds, bool _payTaxWithEscrow) public lockerNotPaused {
    -- SNIP -- 
    - if (listingType != Enums.ListingType.LIQUID) revert CannotCancelListingType();
    + if (listingType != Enums.ListingType.DUTCH && listingType != Enums.ListingType.LIQUID) revert CannotCancelListingType();
}
```


This adjustment ensures that Dutch auctions can be closed at any time, allowing users to retrieve any remaining pre-paid interest.
