# User can cancel or modify Dutch auctions, compromising market integrity and user trust

### Summary

A lack of listing type preservation during relisting can be exploited by by users to modify or cancel Dutch auctions, violating core protocol principles.


### Root Cause

In Listings.sol, there's a critical oversight in the relist function that allows bypassing restrictions on Dutch auctions and Liquidation listings. Here's a detailed walkthrough:

The modifyListings and cancelListings functions have checks to prevent modification of Dutch auctions:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L312 and https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/Listings.sol#L430

```solidity
function modifyListings(address _collection, ModifyListing[] calldata _modifyListings, bool _payTaxWithEscrow) public nonReentrant lockerNotPaused returns (uint taxRequired_, uint refund_) {
    // ...
    if (getListingType(listing) != Enums.ListingType.LIQUID) revert InvalidListingType();
    // ...
}

function cancelListings(address _collection, uint[] memory _tokenIds, bool _payTaxWithEscrow) public lockerNotPaused {
    // ...
    if (getListingType(listing) != Enums.ListingType.LIQUID) revert CannotCancelListingType();
    // ...
}
```

However, the relist function lacks these checks:

```solidity
function relist(CreateListing calldata _listing, bool _payTaxWithEscrow) public nonReentrant lockerNotPaused {
    // Read the existing listing in a single read
    Listing memory oldListing = _listings[_collection][_tokenId];

    // Ensure the caller is not the owner of the listing
    if (oldListing.owner == msg.sender) revert CallerIsAlreadyOwner();

    // ... price difference payment logic ...

    // We can process a tax refund for the existing listing
    (uint _fees,) = _resolveListingTax(oldListing, _collection, true);

    // Validate our new listing
    _validateCreateListing(_listing);

    // Store our listing into our Listing mappings
    _listings[_collection][_tokenId] = listing;

    // Pay our required taxes
    payTaxWithEscrow(address(collectionToken), getListingTaxRequired(listing, _collection), _payTaxWithEscrow);

    // ... events ...
}
```
This function allows any non-owner to relist an item, potentially changing its type from Dutch or liquidation to liquid. The attacker suffers minimal loss due to:

a) Tax refund for the old listing:
```solidity
(uint _fees,) = _resolveListingTax(oldListing, _collection, true);
```
b) Immediate cancellation after relisting, which refunds most of the new listing's tax:
```solidity
function _resolveListingTax(Listing memory _listing, address _collection, bool _action) private returns (uint fees_, uint refund_) {
    // ...
    if (block.timestamp < _listing.created + _listing.duration) {
        refund_ = (_listing.duration - (block.timestamp - _listing.created)) * taxPaid / _listing.duration;
    }
    // ...
}
```
This oversight allows attackers to bypass the intended restrictions on Dutch auctions and Liquidation listings, violating the core principle of auction immutability with minimal financial loss.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker creates a Dutch auction or liquidation listing from Wallet A.
2. Attacker uses Wallet B to call relist, converting the Dutch auction to a Liquid listing by modifying the duration.
3. Attacker immediately cancels the new liquid listing using cancelListings at minimal cost.

### Impact

The NFT holders and potential bidders suffer a loss of trust and market efficiency. The attacker gains the ability to manipulate auctions, potentially extracting value by gaming the system. This violates the core principle stated in the whitepaper like around  expiry of a liquid auction - `the item is immediately locked into a dutch auction where the price falls from its current floor multiple down to the floor (1x) over a period of 4 days.` However, as seen in this issue, the lock can be broken by just relisting and then cancelling. The issue affects not only Dutch auctions but also liquidation listings which can be similarly canceled or modified and is not properly handled.  For example, in case a liquidation listing is cancelled, the `_isLiquidation[_collection][_tokenId]` flag is not cleared causing further issues.
