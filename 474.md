# no use of safeMint() as safe guard for users

## Summary
_safeMint() should be used with reentrancy guards as a guard to protect the user as it checks to see if a user can properly accept an NFT and reverts otherwise.
## Vulnerability Detail
  ICollectionToken token = _collectionToken[_collection];
        token.mint(_recipient, tokenIdsLength * 1 ether * 10 ** token.denomination());

 @> _collectionToken[_collection].mint(msg.sender, _amount);
    }
## Impact
_safeMint() should be used with reentrancy guards as a guard to protect the user as it checks to see if a user can properly accept an NFT and reverts otherwise.
