# Incorrect bit shifting in `CollectionShutdown::_createSudoswapPool` will lead to wrong critical information and unintended behavior

## Summary
In [CollectionShutdown](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol) when quorum is reached the function [execute](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L231) is called. After approving SudoSwap pair to use the protocol's NFT the function attempts to create pool via [_creadeSudoswapPool](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/utils/CollectionShutdown.sol#L478).

The `_createSudoswapPool` have to create Sudoswap pool and it looks like this:

```js
    function _createSudoswapPool(IERC721 _collection, uint[] calldata _tokenIds) internal returns (address) {
        return address(
            pairFactory.createPairERC721ETH({
                _nft: _collection,
                _bondingCurve: curve,
                _assetRecipient: payable(address(this)),
                _poolType: ILSSVMPair.PoolType.NFT,
                _delta: uint128(block.timestamp) << 96 | uint128(block.timestamp + 7 days) << 64,
                _fee: 0,
                _spotPrice: 500 ether,
                _propertyChecker: address(0),
                _initialNFTIDs: _tokenIds
            })
        );
    }
```
The function calls the [createPairERC721ETH](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/interfaces/lssvm2/ILSSVMPairFactoryLike.sol#L16) with the input params above.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `_delta` in `createPairERC721ETH` expect input param to be in `uint128`. The above packing and shifting operation results in a value that give undesired results.  This could lead to incorrect data being passed to other contract functions that rely on the full packed value.
The higher bits of the packed timestamp are shifted wrongly, which will result in incorrect or incomplete timestamp data.
Functions that rely on _delta for time-sensitive logic (shutting down collection and auction on Sudoswap) will not work as expected due to the incorrectly packed information.

PoC:
1. `uint128(block.timestamp) << 96`
`block.timestamp`: the `block.timestamp` is a Unix timestamp, which requires approximately 31 bits in practice.
Bit Shift (<< 96): This shifts the value left by 96 bits.
After this shift, the value will occupy the topmost 32 bits of a uint128 (because 128 - 96 = 32), and the lower 96 bits will be zeroed out.

Result: The final value will take up the top 32 bits of the uint128, and the rest (lower 96 bits) will be zeros.

2. `uint128(block.timestamp + 7 days) << 64`
block.timestamp + 7 days: representing a date 7 days into the future. It requires also about 31 bits in practice.
Bit Shift (<< 64): This shifts the value left by 64 bits.
After this shift, the value will occupy the upper 64 bits of a uint128, and the lower 64 bits will be zeroed out.

Result: The final value will take up the upper 64 bits of the uint128, and the lower 64 bits will be zeros.

In both cases, because of the shifts, the timestamp data is placed in the upper bits of the uint128, leaving the lower bits as zeros. Here's a simplified view of the bit allocations:

uint128(block.timestamp) << 96: occupies the top 32 bits.

uint128(block.timestamp + 7 days) << 64: occupies the upper 64 bits.

Both of these shifts place the timestamp data in high bits of the uint128. However, given that uint128 is only 128 bits wide, when you try to combine both values (such as through a bitwise OR), the second value will be give unexpectedly large result making this an invalid packing approach.

To test this first create contract `TimestampPackingPoC.sol` in `flayer/src/contracts` and copy the following code:
```js
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.22;

contract TimestampPackingPoC {
    uint128 public originalTimestamp;
    uint128 public futureTimestamp;
    uint128 public packedValue;

    function packTimestamps() external {
        // Example timestamps
        originalTimestamp = uint128(block.timestamp);
        futureTimestamp = uint128(block.timestamp + 7 days);
        
        // Shift and pack into 128 bits
        uint128 shiftedOriginal = originalTimestamp << 96;
        uint128 shiftedFuture = futureTimestamp << 64;

        // Combine the values with a bitwise OR
        packedValue = shiftedOriginal | shiftedFuture;
    }

    function unpackTimestamps() external view returns (uint128 unpackedOriginal, uint128 unpackedFuture) {
        // Unpack the original and future timestamps from the packed value
        unpackedOriginal = packedValue >> 96;
        unpackedFuture = (packedValue >> 64) & 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF;
    }
}
```
Then create `TimestampPackingPoCTest.t.sol` in `flayer/src/test` and copy the following code:
```js
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.22;

import "forge-std/Test.sol";
import "forge-std/console.sol";
import "@flayer/TimestampPackingPoC.sol";

contract TimestampPackingPoCTest is Test {
    TimestampPackingPoC public timestampPackingPoC;

    function setUp() public {
        timestampPackingPoC = new TimestampPackingPoC();
    }

    function test_PackingAndTruncation() public {
        // Call the packTimestamps function
        timestampPackingPoC.packTimestamps();

        // Get the packed value
        uint128 packedValue = timestampPackingPoC.packedValue();
        console.log("Packed Value:", packedValue);

        // Unpack the values
        (uint128 unpackedOriginal, uint128 unpackedFuture) = timestampPackingPoC.unpackTimestamps();
        console.log("Unpacked Original Timestamp:", unpackedOriginal);
        console.log("Unpacked Future Timestamp:", unpackedFuture);

        // Get the original timestamps from the contract
        uint128 originalTimestamp = timestampPackingPoC.originalTimestamp();
        uint128 futureTimestamp = timestampPackingPoC.futureTimestamp();
        console.log("Original Timestamp:", originalTimestamp);
        console.log("Future Timestamp (7 days later):", futureTimestamp);
    }
}
```
Run this command:
```terminal
forge test --mt test_PackingAndTruncation -vvv
```

The test will pass and the following values are:
```terminal
Ran 1 test for test/TimestampPackingPoCTest.t.sol:TimestampPackingPoCTest
[PASS] test_PackingAndTruncation() (gas: 59631)
Logs:
  Packed Value: 79239319123526861204070858752
  Unpacked Original Timestamp: 1
  Unpacked Future Timestamp: 4295572097
  Original Timestamp: 1
  Future Timestamp (7 days later): 604801
```
The 1 is not a realistic timestamp for a real world but for a test we can start time from the beginning to understand results better.
The Unpacked Future Timestamp is much larger and represents a value that does not align with the original expected future timestamp. This indicates that the bit shifts and overlap caused incorrect unpacking.


`4295572097s = 49,717.27 days.`
`604801s = 7 days`

## Impact
Incorrect shifting bits could lead to loss of a critical information, which could lead to unintended behavior (auction time to be way more than it should (over 100+ years)) or to auction not be able to created at all.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
One solution is to shift bits by the following amount to keep both values correct:
```diff
    function _createSudoswapPool(IERC721 _collection, uint[] calldata _tokenIds) internal returns (address) {
        return address(
            pairFactory.createPairERC721ETH({ // qanswered check this func and input params
                _nft: _collection,
                _bondingCurve: curve,
                _assetRecipient: payable(address(this)),
                _poolType: ILSSVMPair.PoolType.NFT,
-                _delta: uint128(block.timestamp) << 96 | uint128(block.timestamp + 7 days) << 64, 
+                _delta: uint128(block.timestamp) << 96 | uint128(block.timestamp + 7 days) << 32,
                _fee: 0,
                _spotPrice: 500 ether,
                _propertyChecker: address(0),
                _initialNFTIDs: _tokenIds
            })
        );
    }
```
or 

Change packing and shifting in `_delta` to fit correctly with SudoSwap bonding curve and desired auction style so it does not lose important data.
More info about `_delta` and bonding curves you can find in their docs [here](https://docs.sudoswap.xyz/reference/pricing/).
