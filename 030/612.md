# `ERC721Bridgable` & `ERC1155Bridgable` won't deploy on zkSync chain correctly

## Summary
`ERC721Bridgable` & `ERC1155Bridgable` won't deploy on zkSync chain correctly

## Vulnerability Detail
User can send ERC721 & ERC1155 tokens from L1 to L2 using `crossTheThreshold()/ crossTheThreshold1155()`. This deploys a `ERC721Bridgable & ERC1155Bridgable` contract in InfernalRiftBelow.sol using `Clone` library of openzeppelin
```solidity
function _thresholdCross721(Package memory package, address recipient) internal returns (address l2CollectionAddress) {
...
        // If not yet deployed, deploy the L2 collection and set name/symbol/royalty
        if (!isDeployedOnL2(l1CollectionAddress, false)) {
@>          Clones.cloneDeterministic(ERC721_BRIDGABLE_IMPLEMENTATION, bytes32(bytes20(l1CollectionAddress)));
...
    }
```
```solidity
    function _thresholdCross1155(Package memory package, address recipient) internal returns (address l2CollectionAddress) {
...
        // If not yet deployed, deploy the L2 collection and set name/symbol/royalty
        if (!isDeployedOnL2(l1CollectionAddress, true)) {
@>          Clones.cloneDeterministic(ERC1155_BRIDGABLE_IMPLEMENTATION, bytes32(bytes20(l1CollectionAddress)));
...
    }
```

Now, readme of the contest states that Moongate will be deployed on Mainnet & any EVM compatible L2 chain

Now, the problem is, openzeppelin's Clone.sol will not work correctly on the zkSync chain. This is because, for the `create/create2` opcodes to function correctly on the zkSync chain, the compiler must be aware of the bytecode of the deployed contract in advance.

Quoting from [ZKsync docs](https://docs.zksync.io/build/developer-reference/ethereum-differences/evm-instructions) :

"On ZKsync Era, contract deployment is performed using the hash of the bytecode, and the factoryDeps field of EIP712 transactions contains the bytecode. The actual deployment occurs by providing the contract's hash to the ContractDeployer system contract.
To guarantee that create/create2 functions operate correctly, the compiler must be aware of the bytecode of the deployed contract in advance. The compiler interprets the calldata arguments as incomplete input for ContractDeployer, as the remaining part is filled in by the compiler internally. The Yul datasize and dataoffset instructions have been adjusted to return the constant size and bytecode hash rather than the bytecode itself."

This is `Clone:cloneDeterministic()`, we can see it uses `create2`
```solidity
 function cloneDeterministic(address implementation, bytes32 salt) internal returns (address instance) {
        /// @solidity memory-safe-assembly
        assembly {
            // Cleans the upper 96 bits of the `implementation` word, then packs the first 3 bytes
            // of the `implementation` address with the bytecode before the address.
            mstore(0x00, or(shr(0xe8, shl(0x60, implementation)), 0x3d602d80600a3d3981f3363d3d373d3d3d363d73000000))
            // Packs the remaining 17 bytes of `implementation` with the bytecode after the address.
            mstore(0x20, or(shl(0x78, implementation), 0x5af43d82803e903d91602b57fd5bf3))
@>          instance := create2(0, 0x09, 0x37, salt)
        }
        require(instance != address(0), "ERC1167: create2 failed");
    }
```
## Impact
Deployments will not work/ deploy faulty contracts on the ZKsync chain.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make sure the compiler is aware of the bytecode beforehand.
This can be solved by implementing CREATE2 directly as mentioned in the zkSync Era docs.
