# Create2 Opcode works differently in zkSync

## Summary
`zkSync Era` chain has differences in the usage of the `create` / `create2` opcode compared to the EVM.

## Vulnerability Detail
The project doesn't explicitly mention that they are compatible in zkSync but since they have mentioned they are compatible in any EVM  for `Moongate`, so thought of mentioning this. 

The description of CREATE and CREATE2 (<https://docs.zksync.io/build/developer-reference/ethereum-differences/evm-instructions#create-create2>) states that Create cannot be used for arbitrary code unknown to the compiler.

`  _thresholdCross721` function uses OZ's  `Clones:cloneDeterministic` function: for creation of a `ERC721_BRIDGABLE_IMPLEMENTATION` contract with a specific initialization data, if it is not initialized or deployed before hand .
One can check this lines for more information ::
```
 if (!isDeployedOnL2(l1CollectionAddress, true)) {
            Clones.cloneDeterministic(ERC1155_BRIDGABLE_IMPLEMENTATION, bytes32(bytes20(l1CollectionAddress)));

            // Check if we have an ERC721 or an ERC1155
            l2Collection1155 = ERC1155Bridgable(l2CollectionAddress);
            l2Collection1155.initialize(package.royaltyBps, package.chainId, l1CollectionAddress);
````

As mentioned by the zkSync docs: "The code will not function correctly because the compiler is not aware of the bytecode beforehand".

## Impact
Simply fail  while deploying to zkSYnc

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Try using `create2` opcode directly or the other possible ways as mentioned in the zk sync docs
