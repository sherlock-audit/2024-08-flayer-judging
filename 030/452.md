# ZkSync Era deployment Issues with Clones and CREATE2.

## Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/moongate/src/InfernalRiftBelow.sol#L242

The function _thresholdCross721 deploys an ERC721 collection on zkSync if it hasn't been deployed yet. It then transfers tokens to a specified recipient. 
The function uses `Clones.cloneDeterministic` to deploy the implementation, which will be fail on zkSync due to differences in EVM bytecode and zkEVM bytecode.

## Vulnerability Detail
The key issue here is the incompatibility between EIP-1167’s bytecode (used by the Clones.cloneDeterministic function) and the bytecode format expected by zkSync’s zkEVM. This incompatibility can cause unexpected reverts or deployment failures when interacting with zkSync.

EIP-1167 in the context of the system is used to deploy ERC721Bridgable using CREATE2 opcode.
```solidity
function _thresholdCross721(Package memory package, address recipient) internal returns(address l2CollectionAddress) {
    //...
    if (!isDeployedOnL2(l1CollectionAddress, false)) {
@>>>    Clones.cloneDeterministic(ERC721_BRIDGABLE_IMPLEMENTATION, bytes32(bytes20(l1CollectionAddress)));
        //...
    }
    //...
}

function cloneDeterministic(address implementation, bytes32 salt) internal returns(address instance) {
     /// @solidity memory-safe-assembly
     assembly {
         // Cleans the upper 96 bits of the `implementation` word, then packs the first 3 bytes
         // of the `implementation` address with the bytecode before the address.
         mstore(0x00, or(shr(0xe8, shl(0x60, implementation)), 0x3d602d80600a3d3981f3363d3d373d3d3d363d73000000))
         // Packs the remaining 17 bytes of `implementation` with the bytecode after the address.
         mstore(0x20, or(shl(0x78, implementation), 0x5af43d82803e903d91602b57fd5bf3))
@>>>     instance := create2(0, 0x09, 0x37, salt)
     }

     require(instance != address(0), "ERC1167: create2 failed");
}

```

However, [as mentioned here by the zkSync Community Hub](https://github.com/zkSync-Community-Hub/zksync-developers/discussions/91#discussioncomment-7099927) the reason why this is currently not supported is because EIP-1167 is written directly in EVM bytecode, which is quite different from the bytecode that zkEVM operates on.

## Impact
The function will fail to deploy/Clone the collection on zkSync.

## Recommendation
this issue can be solved by using create2:
