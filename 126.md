# Anyone can cause DoS to `createCollection` function

## Summary
`createCollection()` using `cloneDeterministic` to deploy new ERC20 token in a deterministic way can be leveraged by malicious actor to cause a DoS while registering a collection

## Vulnerability Detail
`createCollection()` function is used to register a new collection and deploy and underlying clone against it, however while doing so it deploys our new ERC20 token using Clone. The `createCollection()` calls the `cloneDeterministic` method from `LibClone` that uses the `create2` opcode, The `createCollection()` method also has a `salt` parameter that is passed to the `cloneDeterministic`, The salt parameter is a bytes 32 argument which in this case is `bytes32(_collectionCount)`.

```solidity
ICollectionToken collectionToken_ = ICollectionToken(LibClone.cloneDeterministic(tokenImplementation, bytes32(_collectionCount)));
```

 A malicious actor can front-run every call to `createCollection()` and use the same `salt` argument i.e `bytes32(_collectionCount)`. This will result in reverts of all user transactions, as there is already a contract at the address that `create2` tries to deploy to and easily cause a DoS.
## Impact
DoS while registering a collection

## Tool used
[A little bit of secret salt](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cafef262-26ad-404b-8b5a-2dcac5128c5b)


## Recommendation
Use a unique salt parameter such as adding msg.sender.
