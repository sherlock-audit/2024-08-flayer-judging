# Missing Harberger Fee Deduction in CollectionToken.mint

### Summary

## Bug Report: Harberger Fees Not Deducted During Liquid Listing

**1. Bug Title:** Missing Harberger Fee Deduction in CollectionToken.mint 

**2. Trigger Condition:**

This bug is triggered whenever a user creates a Liquid Listing for an NFT. The CollectionToken contract, responsible for minting the fungible representation (ƒ tokens) of the listed NFT, does not deduct the pre-paid Harberger Fees as specified in the whitepaper. 

**3. PoC Flow:**

1. **User Lists NFT:** A user initiates a Liquid Listing for a non-floor NFT, setting a desired floor multiple (redemption price).
2. **CollectionToken.mint Called:**  The platform calls the `CollectionToken.mint` function to issue ƒ tokens to the user representing the initial liquidity received for the listing (equivalent to one floor NFT).
3. **No Fee Deduction:** The `mint` function in `CollectionToken.sol` unconditionally mints the full `_amount` of ƒ tokens to the user without deducting any pre-paid Harberger Fees.

**4. Impact:**

- **Free Liquidity Exploitation:**  Users can list their NFTs at extremely inflated prices while still receiving the full amount of floor tokens (1 ƒ token), effectively obtaining free and unbacked liquidity.
- **ƒ Token Depegging:**  The unchecked minting of ƒ tokens without proper fee deduction dilutes their value and leads to a disconnect between the token price and the actual market value of the underlying NFTs.
- **Unhealthy Listing Ecosystem:** Incentivizes manipulative listings with exorbitant redemption prices, hindering legitimate trading and "Trade-Up" opportunities.
- **Protocol Sustainability Threat:** Undermines the core value proposition of the Harberger Fee model, which is designed to encourage fair pricing and discourage price manipulation. 

**5. Code Snippet: `CollectionToken.mint`:**

```solidity
/**
 * Allows our creating contract to mint additional ERC20 tokens when required.
 *
 * @param _to The recipient of the minted token
 * @param _amount The number of tokens to mint
 */
function mint(address _to, uint _amount) public onlyOwner {
    if (_to == address(0)) revert MintAddressIsZero();
    _mint(_to, _amount); // <--- Full amount minted without fee deduction 
}
```

**Recommendation:**

Modify the `CollectionToken.mint` function to first calculate and deduct the pre-paid Harberger Fee from the total `_amount` before minting the remaining amount of ƒ tokens to the user. This modification will ensure that users pay the required interest on their listings, promoting fair pricing and a robust ecosystem.
