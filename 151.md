# Solidity introduced tstore() and tload() after version 0.8.24, and multiple contract versions do not meet the requirements.

## Summary
Solidity introduced tstore() and tload() after version 0.8.24, and multiple contract versions do not meet the requirements.
## Vulnerability Detail
This project uses tload in several contracts, but TSTORE and TLOAD are only updated in version 0.8.24 and later. 
For more information, please refer to here:
https://soliditylang.org/blog/2024/01/26/transient-storage/
https://soliditylang.org/blog/2024/01/26/solidity-0.8.24-release-announcement
In the ProtectedListings.sol and Listings.sol contracts, the pragma solidity ^0.8.22 version is used, which is lower than 0.8.24.
## Impact
If you are using Solidity version 0.8.22 and your code uses tload() and tstore(), this is incorrect because these Yul built-in functions were introduced in version 0.8.24.

```solidity
            assembly { checkpointIndex := tload(checkpointKey) }
            if (checkpointIndex == 0) {
                checkpointIndex = _createCheckpoint(listing.collection);
                assembly { tstore(checkpointKey, checkpointIndex) }
            }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1.You may consider replacing tload() and tstore() with regular Solidity storage access methods. For example, access the contract's state variables directly instead of relying on Yul's low-level memory access methods.
2.pragma solidity ^0.8.22; changed to pragma solidity ^0.8.24;
