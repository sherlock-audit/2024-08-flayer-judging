# Data type mismatch will cause incorrect event emission in listing floor multiple updates

## Summary
A data type mismatch occurs when emitting the `Listings::ListingFloorMultipleUpdated` event, as the `listing.floorMultiple` and `params.floorMultiple` are of type `uint16`, while the event expects `uint32`. This mismatch can lead to incorrect values being logged in events, potentially causing data inconsistency.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the contract, `listing.floorMultiple` and `params.floorMultiple` are defined as `uint16`. However, when emitting the `ListingFloorMultipleUpdated` event, the contract attempts to pass these `uint16` values to parameters that are defined as `uint32` in the event signature. This discrepancy results in a data type mismatch, which may cause incorrect data to be emitted to the event logs.

## Impact
**Incorrect Event Logs:** The values for floorMultiple in the event could be inaccurately represented, leading to incorrect event data.
**Potential Off-Chain Issues:** Off-chain services or dApps relying on accurate event logs might process incorrect data, leading to unintended behavior or misreporting.
**Data Integrity Concerns:** Auditors or third parties tracking the contractâ€™s state through events may see incorrect values, affecting the transparency and reliability of event logs.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure that the data types in both the event and the contract are consistent. Depending on the intended design, either:

1. Update the Event Definition: If the `floorMultiple` is supposed to be `uint16`, modify the event to expect `uint16` instead of `uint32`.
```solidity
event ListingFloorMultipleUpdated(address indexed _collection, uint _tokenId, uint16 _oldFloorMultiple, uint16 _newFloorMultiple);
```

2. Update the Contract: If the floorMultiple is supposed to be `uint32`, update the Listing struct and other relevant variables to use `uint32` instead of `uint16`. 
```solidity
struct Listing {
    address payable owner;
    uint40 created;
    uint32 duration;
    uint32 floorMultiple;  // Change this to uint32
}

```
