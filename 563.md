# Inefficient beneficiary pool fee distribution when `beneficiaryIsPool == true`

## Summary
If beneficiery is a pool, then the fee donation is delayed. Also impact varies depending on if the beneficiery pool is same pool (`beneficiaryIsPool == true`) the fee is split from or if different.

Fix : if pool beneficiery is same as the pool fee split from, just donate on the same transaction itself.

## Vulnerability Detail
Issue flow : 
1. There 0.5 ETH to be ditributed and fee split is like 0.3 ETH to direct pool and 0.2 ETH to beneficiery.
2. Here, the beneficiery is actually a pool (maybe the same or another)

Look at line 393,
If it's the same, the 0.2 ethe should be fully sent to the pool in the same transaction. But the 0.2 ETH is again split based on teh beneficiary royalty on the next distribution call. The current flow is fine if the 0.2 ETH beneficiary fee of BAYC is added to MAYC pool and that 0.2 ETH is further split between the MAYC beneficiary and MAYC pool.

IF the benficiery is same pool, then splitting the 0.2 ETH fee further again and again is inefficient and delays the fee donation based on teh uni v4 pool activity. Since, the fees needs to meet minimum donation threshold of 0.001 eth.

## Impact
If beneficiary is a pool, then the fee donation is delayed. Also, the impact varies depending on if the beneficiery pool is same pool the fee is split from or if different. (`beneficiaryIsPool == true`)

## Recommendation
Donate the beneficiary fee to the pool if the `beneficiaryIsPool` == true
