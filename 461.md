# lack of validation for minimum and maximum threshold in `setDonateThresholds` function.

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
in BaseImplementation::setDonateThresholds there is no validation of mximum and minimum
as we see here :
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/BaseImplementation.sol#L58-L62
but while set this values : 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/BaseImplementation.sol#L257-L262
there is no check if `donateThresholdMax` is more than 0.1 ether or not.
## Impact
if an owner mistakenly or maliciously sets `_donateThresholdMax` to a value greater than 0.1 ether, it could lead to unintended consequences in the donation flow.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
add
```solidity
if (_donateThresholdMax > 0.1 ether) revert InvalidMaxThreshold(); 
```
