# Malicious Whale can cause Loss of Fees of LP Providers

### Summary

When `BeforeSwap()` hook gets called it retrieves the current price of the Pair by `slot0` which is manipulatable by attacker so that the pool do the swap of the fees at very unfavorable price causing loss of funds to them and giving more favorable price to the attacker.
### Root Cause
Retrieval of `sqrtPriceX96` in `beforeSwap()` Hook  via `getSlot0` which is manipulatable 

### Internal pre-conditions

The collection Pool has the minimum initialized Liquidity (10 fNFT Tokens), or less if collection initializer withdrawn any to make the attack more feasible

ammFee is not set to make the attack more profitable, but not dependant on it
### External pre-conditions

Whale Malicious Actor Having High number of NFTs of that collection

### Attack Path

1. Malicious whale makes 1K fNFT Tokens swap in the direction of (1 for 0 which doesn't trigger `beforeSwap()` Hook [Here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/UniswapImplementation.sol#L501-L502)) that moves the price of fNFT token very low compared to `wETH`
2. That malicious whale makes a swap in the direction of  0 for 1 with 
3. `beforeSwap` Hook logic gets triggered and the swap Delta amounts gets computed [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/implementation/UniswapImplementation.sol#L534-L541)  since the attacker chose to take what ever fees he can take by specifying `params.amountSpecified` to be < 0 
4. Since price was retrieved here `(uint160 sqrtPriceX96,,,) = poolManager.getSlot0(poolId);` the price we are executing at is the manipulated very low fNFT-wETH making `ethIn` low amount and `tokenOut` as the whole Fees
5. The swap gets executed and the fees of that Pool are all sent to the that user in very low price
6. Then The malicious whale tries to revert the step one swap and the `beforeSwap` hook won't do any thing since the `pendingPoolFees.amount1` are all swapped already
7. Now That Whale has swapped the pool fees and provided very low `wETH` by sandwiching his txn, he can now dump those `collectionToken` on the Pool by selling them in the their real Price after he revert his step 1, this profits him and makes LP providers lose funds



### Impact
Loss of fees to that pool Liquidity Providers, forcing them to sell at my manipulated price


### Mitigation
use TWAP for fees swapping
