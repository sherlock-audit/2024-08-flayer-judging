# Absence of `unchecked` block may lead to overflow in the `InfernalRiftBelow` contract

## Summary
Absence of `unchecked` block may lead to overflow in the `InfernalRiftBelow` contract, leading to DoS in the bridging mechanism
## Vulnerability Detail
When sending a message to L2, the `InfernalRiftBelow::thresholdCross()` is called. There we can find the following block of code:
```javascript
        address expectedAliasedSender = address(
            uint160(INFERNAL_RIFT_ABOVE) +
                uint160(0x1111000000000000000000000000000000001111)
        );
```
This is because when a message is send from L1 to L2 and `msg.sender` is a contract, this offset is added to the L1 address of the sender, to compute its L2 address. The problem here is that both addresses are casted to `uint160` and in some cases the `uint160(INFERNAL_RIFT_ABOVE) +
                uint160(0x1111000000000000000000000000000000001111)` operation may overflow leading to DoS.
## Proof of code
Lets act for a second that the `INFERNAL_RIFT_ABOVE` address is `0xf000000000000000000000000000000000000000`. Then the test will look like this:
```javascript
function test_KiroBrejka() public returns (uint160) {
        return (uint160(0xf000000000000000000000000000000000000000) +
            uint160(0x1111000000000000000000000000000000001111));
    }
```
And the output looks like this

## Impact
If the `INFERNAL_RIFT_ABOVE` is such address that leads to overflow when added to the additional offset (0x1111000000000000000000000000000000001111), Then there will a be a total DoS of the bridging process.

## Recommendation
Wrap the code into an `unchecked` block like this:
```javascript
 unchecked {
            address expectedAliasedSender = address(
            uint160(INFERNAL_RIFT_ABOVE) +
                uint160(0x1111000000000000000000000000000000001111)
        );
}
```
