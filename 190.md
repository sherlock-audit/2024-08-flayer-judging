# ERC721's without the metadata extension won't be bridgeable

### Summary

In `InfernalRiftAbove` it will read the ERC721's metadata for every token in bridges. The call will revert for any ERC721 contract that doesn't implement the optional Metadata extension.

### Root Cause

The ERC721 metadata extension which includes the `tokenURI()` function is optional, see https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721.

Any ERC721 that doesn't implement the `tokenURI()` function won't be bridgeable because the call in [InfernalRiftAbove.sol:105](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/main/moongate/src/InfernalRiftAbove.sol#L105) will revert
