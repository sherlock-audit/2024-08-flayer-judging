# Unrestricted Manager Approval Leading to Potential Protocol Conflicts

## Summary
The `LockerManager` contract allows the owner to approve multiple managers without any restrictions or checks. This can lead to potential protocol conflicts if multiple managers interact with assets registered on different contracts simultaneously. Additionally, there is no mechanism to revoke access or permissions for managers once they are removed, posing a risk of unauthorized access.

## Vulnerability Detail
The core issue lies in the `setManager` function, which allows the owner to approve or unapprove managers without any constraints on the number of managers that can be active at the same time. 
```solidity
41:     function setManager(address _manager, bool _approved) public onlyOwner {
---
43:         if (_manager == address(0)) revert ManagerIsZeroAddress();
44: 
---
46:         if (_managers[_manager] == _approved) revert StateAlreadySet();
47: 
---
49:         _managers[_manager] = _approved;
50:         emit ManagerSet(_manager, _approved);
51:     }
```
This function does not have any restrictions on the number of managers that can be approved, nor is there any mechanism to revoke access or permissions for managers once they are removed.

## Impact
- Multiple managers interacting with the same assets can lead to competing conditions, inconsistencies, and other operational conflicts.
- Removed managers may still have access to assets or permissions, leading to potential unauthorized actions or asset manipulation.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Implement a mechanism to limit the number of managers that can be approved at any given time.
- Make sure that when a manager is removed, any permissions or access rights they had are revoked.

+ uint256 public maxManagers = 3; // Example of limits for active managers

function setManager(address _manager, bool _approved) public onlyOwner {
    // Ensure we don't try to update a zero address
    if (_manager == address(0)) revert ManagerIsZeroAddress();

    // Ensure we aren't setting to existing value
    if (_managers[_manager] == _approved) revert StateAlreadySet();

+   if (_approved) {
+       require(activeManagers < maxManagers, "Max managers limit reached");
+       activeManagers++;
+   } else {
        // Logic for revoking permission from a manager
+       revokeManagerPermissions(_manager);
+       activeManagers--;
    }

    // Set our manager to the new state
    _managers[_manager] = _approved;
    emit ManagerSet(_manager, _approved);
}

+ function revokeManagerPermissions(address _manager) internal {
    // Implement logic to revoke permissions or access rights
    // related to the manager. This may involve interaction
    // with another contract or update internal status to ensure
    // managers no longer have control over the assets.
