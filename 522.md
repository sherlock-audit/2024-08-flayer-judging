# Division Truncation will Reduce Precision

### Summary

The `testOperations` test case highlights a recurring issue in the codebase: incorrect order of operations in calculations involving multiplication and division. This vulnerability affects multiple contracts and can lead to inaccurate results, potentially causing financial losses.

### Root Cause

In Solidity, precision issues often occur due to how integer division is handled. Solidity does not support floating-point numbers, meaning all arithmetic is performed using integers. When dividing two integers, the result is truncated, discarding any decimal or fractional part. This can lead to significant loss of precision, especially in calculations where scaling factors like percentages or small fractions are involved.

For instance, if you perform a division before applying a multiplier, the fractional part of the result is lost. To avoid this, it's common to first multiply the numbers by a scaling factor (like 100 or 1e18) before performing division. This preserves more precision during the calculation because the scaling factor amplifies the numbers before they are divided, effectively simulating the effect of floating-point arithmetic.

In general, the key to maintaining precision in Solidity is to ensure that multiplication happens before division when dealing with scaling factors. This minimizes the loss of accuracy caused by the truncation of fractional values in integer division.

### Internal pre-conditions

• Ensure all arithmetic calculations involving scaling factors or percentages use proper order of operations.
• Verify that calculations involving large numbers are tested for precision and accuracy.

### External pre-conditions

• The protocol or contract must be tested in various scenarios, including edge cases with large numbers and small fractions.
• Contracts interacting with financial data must be audited for arithmetic correctness.

### Attack Path

1. Identify operations where multiplication and division are involved, particularly with scaling factors or percentages.
2. Review and correct the order of operations to ensure that multiplication occurs before division to preserve precision.
3. Test and verify the corrected calculations with different scenarios to ensure accuracy.

### Impact

The impact of this vulnerability varies depending on the specific calculation and context. However, in general, it can lead to:

- **Inaccurate Calculations:** Incorrect results in calculations involving interest rates, fees, tax amounts, and other financial parameters.
- **Financial Losses:** Users may receive less than they are entitled to, or the protocol may incur losses due to incorrect calculations.

### PoC

You can test one of occurencies with this test function. Copy and paste that on **`test/TaxCalculator.t.sol`**:

```solidity
function testOperations() public {
    uint previousCompoundedFactor = 1e18;
    uint utilizationRate = 1e18;
    uint timePeriod = 1 days;

    // Calculate the compounded factor using the original function
    uint resultOriginal = taxCalculator.calculateCompoundedFactor(
        previousCompoundedFactor,
        utilizationRate,
        timePeriod
    );

    // Calculate the expected compounded factor with corrected order of operations
    uint interestRate = taxCalculator.calculateProtectedInterest(
        utilizationRate
    );
    uint perSecondRate = (interestRate * 1e18) / (365 * 24 * 60 * 60);
    uint expectedCompoundedFactor = (previousCompoundedFactor *
        (1e18 + ((perSecondRate * timePeriod) / 1000))) / 1e18;

    // The assertion fails because the original calculation is incorrect
    assertEq(resultOriginal, expectedCompoundedFactor, "Erro"); 
}
```

### Mitigation

The following code snippets demonstrate the vulnerability and the recommended corrections:

**`src/contracts/TaxCalculator.sol`**

```solidity

interestRate_ = (((_utilizationRate - UTILIZATION_KINK) * (100 - 8) * 100) / (1 ether - UTILIZATION_KINK)) + (8 * 100);

// Line 90: Incorrect
compoundedFactor_ = _previousCompoundedFactor * (1e18 + (perSecondRate / 1000 * _timePeriod)) / 1e18;

// Line 90: Corrected
compoundedFactor_ = _previousCompoundedFactor * (1e18 + ((perSecondRate * _timePeriod) / 1000)) / 1e18;

// Lines 117-118: Incorrect
uint compoundedFactor = _currentCheckpoint.compoundedFactor * 1e18 / _initialCheckpoint.compoundedFactor;
