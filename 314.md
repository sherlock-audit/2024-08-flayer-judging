# Cost of initializing is too high for some collections

## Summary
The only way to create and then initialize a collection is for the caller to deposit a minimum of 10 NFTs, without providing any additional benefits, which can be quite costly for some collections.
## Vulnerability Detail
When initializing a collection, the caller must transfer a [minimum of 10 NFTs](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-flayer/blob/0ec252cf9ef0f3470191dcf8318f6835f5ef688c/flayer/src/contracts/Locker.sol#L372-L373):

```solidity
    uint _tokenIdsLength = _tokenIds.length;
    if (_tokenIdsLength < MINIMUM_TOKEN_IDS) revert InsufficientTokenIds();
```

There is no benefit whatsoever to the initializer, they are treated the same as any other user that wants to deposit/swap/list in the protocol. The issue is that some higher-cost collections can be quite costly to initialize. If we take for example the [20th](https://opensea.io/collection/basedapesgang) and [21st](https://opensea.io/collection/mochimonsbase) BASE top NFT collections we'll see the floor price is right around 0.20ETH, this means the first initializer needs to lock down a minimum of 2ETH/~$4700 just to use the protocol with that collection if it's not already initialized, yet providing no incentive to the first initializer.

This means that seldom will top collections be integrated into the protocol unless the admins themselves make the initial deposit for them. 
## Impact
Top collections are much less likely to be integrated into the protocol.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    uint _tokenIdsLength = _tokenIds.length;
    if (_tokenIdsLength < MINIMUM_TOKEN_IDS) revert InsufficientTokenIds();
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Lower the minimum or allow different users to all submit into a pot until 10 is reached and then the collection automatically initializes and mints collection tokens to the different depositors.
