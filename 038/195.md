# Unrestricted Access to createCollection() Function

## Summary
The createCollection() function allows anyone to create a new ERC20 token associated with an ERC721 collection without access control. This opens the contract to spam attacks and resource exhaustion through repeated creation of collections, potentially leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).

## Vulnerability Detail
The function does not implement any ownership or permission checks, meaning that any user can create a collection by calling createCollection() without restriction. This allows malicious users to spam the system, causing gas consumption and filling up storage with unnecessary collections.

## Impact
The contract can be flooded with multiple collections, leading to increased gas costs and potential network congestion.
The lack of restrictions could result in a bloated contract, making it difficult for legitimate users to interact with it.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement access control to restrict who can call createCollection(). This can be achieved using OpenZeppelinâ€™s AccessControl or Ownable:

```solidity
bytes32 public constant COLLECTION_CREATOR_ROLE = keccak256("COLLECTION_CREATOR_ROLE");

constructor() {
        _setupRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);
}

function createCollection(address _collection, string calldata _name, string calldata _symbol, uint _denomination) public whenNotPaused onlyRole(COLLECTION_CREATOR_ROLE) returns (address) {
...
}
```
